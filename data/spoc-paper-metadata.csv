Adams, 1854), was studied. the intestinal sites of hydrolysis of certain carbohydrates and the location of production of their respective enzymes were studied. The presence of an amylase, laminarase, alginase, fucoidase, and cellobiase was demonstrated. The major tissue sources of the above enzymes were: buccal cavity, stomach, digestive gland, spiral caecum, thin and thick hindgut for amylase; buccal cavity and esophagus for laminarase and alginase; buccal, eshoagus, stomach and digestive gland for fucoidase; salivary glands, spiral caecum, thin and thick hindgut for cellobiase. Some of the carbohydrate hydrolysis appears to be due to bacterial action. Intracellular digestion of starch in the wall of the hindgut is indicated.","black turban snail, Tegula",hms_vf662dy4113.tei.xml
1,Stanford University,Hopkins Marine Station,sm915yx0709,"Best, Barbara A.",Feeding activities of Tegula funebralis,1963.0,"1. Tegula funebrals will ingest nearly any alga growing in or out of the littoral zone. Both macroscopic and encrusting forms constitute important food sources; the granite surfaces contain a negligible amount of organic detritus and contribute little to the diet of the animal. Earlier work on T. funebralis and observations of T. gallina show that the animals will ingest organic detritus when it is available. 2. The snail prefers a ""fleshy"" alga among macroscopic forms (e.g. Macrocystis integrifolia, Nereocystis luetkeana, and Gigartina canaliculata). 3. Feeding rates per gram are greater in the smaller animals and apparently not affected by lack of sunlight. 4. A short field suggests the importance of the feeding activities of Tegula funebralis on the local algal crops.","black turban snail, Tegula",hms_sm915yx0709.tei.xml

Digestive contents were examined microscopically and streaked on to media. The center of density was the stomach, spiral caecum, and digestive gland area, where abundant yeast cells were seen and numerous rod-shaped bacteria cultured. Cocci were seen most abundantly throughout, although rarely cultured. Spiral organisms, thought to be two spirochaetes and a spirillum, were found in the stomach and described.

Adults of P. hirsutiusculus are least able to withstand exposure to air in sunlight. 3) The three species make use of various shells to different degrees. 89% of the Pagurus granosimanus and 75.9% of the P. samuelis collected occupy Tegula funebralis shells, whereas, the smaller P. hirsutiusculus tended to occupy shells of smaller snails such as Epitonium, Mitrella, Homolapoma, etc. to a greater degree. 4) The bigger Pagurid individuals are largely dependent on Tegula funebralis for homes whereas the smaller sized hermit crabs are not, and occupy a variety of small shells. 5) Both Pagurus samuelis and P. hirusutiusculus attain sexual maturity at a relatively small size and thus are not completely dependent on Tegula funebralis for the survival and reproduction of the species. However, when larger shells are not available, the reproduction potential in P. samuelis may be greatly reduced since the smaller individuals produce far fewer eggs than the larger ones.","black turban snail, Tegula",hms_zx897dq3818.tei.xml

Scraping the bottom of the foot, cutting the border between the side and bottom of the foot, removal of the epipodial fringe (on the left side of the foot), removal of up to half of the ctenidium do not noticeably alter chemoreception. The osphradium functions as an olfactory organ and is capable of detecting the presence of an extract containing 2.6 X 10^-5 parts by weight of tube feet from Pisaster ochraceus. The osphradium, when stimulated, seems to cause the animals to be more sensitive to stimulations of the head tentacles and epipodial structures.

Particular emphasis was placed on the impact of substrate characteristics on the observed age distribution. The seals in this area utilize irregularly- shaped offshore rocks for haul out. Aggressive behavior was almost completely absent in this area and seals were never observed battling over haul out space. Substrate features which were examined included: distance to an escape channel: % total and individual algal cover; size of hauling ground; and degree of incline to reach the hauling ground. These features at least partly resulted in the observed segregation of ages as adults were limited by the size of the hauling ground, while subadults and juveniles were limited by the % algal cover and degree of incline.

Further, current causes Tegula to orient into the flow, and also keeps them down near the bottom; if the current is sufficiently strong, however, they will often turn and head for shelter at the first respite. Preliminary tests in a vertical tube (250 cm/min flow) indicate that snails tend to go down regardless of current direction: evidently current stimulation, and not direction, causes Tegula to go down. It was shown that Tegula changed their orientation to current after a few hours: this may be a set pattern of response, or perhaps the snails became fatigued. Gradation of current needs to be tried in all these cases. Finally, there is a definite response to air jets: the snails would clump in regions of greatest turbulence. This turbulence seemed to enhance the effect of light (the snails going down in light, up in dark). It is possible, however, that these results were due to the entering air rather than to the turbulence: further tests are definitely necessary.","black turban snail, Tegula",hms_ns428hx6548.tei.xml

During the time of the current studies the effluent was moving south from the outfall and appeared to remain in the Monastery Beach area due to circular currents. The sewage was not moving straight out to sea. Damage in the outfall area can be seen in the form of distribution patterns and are reflected in the diversity indices for specific types of areas. The distribution patterns suggest that Mytilus californianus (California mussel), Mitella polymerus (Gooseneck barnacle), Balanus glandula, Chthamalus spp., Tetraclita squamosa rubsecens, Acmaea spp., Pisaster ochraceus, Pagurus spp., and Haliotis cracherodii may be good intertidal indicators of sewage pollution.

Increases in percentage clustered was most noted at dawn, and the maximum percentage clustered was recorded during the daylight hours on dry rock. Snails were found to be trapped by shade on drying rock, but they ignore the difference in light intensity when the rock is wet.

Both rocky and sandy fish demonstrated the ability to alter their pattern to match a novel substrate. After 8 days of acclimation, rocky fish matched sand better than sandy fish matched rock. Whether this was the result of all fish becoming sandier after removal from the field is not certain. There may be a cost to maintaining a rocky morphology. If so, it would be more difficult for a sandy fish to gain a rocky morphology than it would for a rocky fish to gain a sandy morphology.

Loligo depends on jet-propulsion for escape behavior, and at 12 degrees C shows an escape response that uses coordination between two motor systems employing giant and non-giant neural fibers. Little is known about escape behavior at colder temperatures, however, and experiments were done to determine how this behavior changed over the biologically relevant temperature range of 12 -4 degrees C. Squid were restrained and recordings of stellar nerve activity and intra-mantle pressure transients were taken during escape behavior elicited by strobe flash stimuli. As temperature decreased, pressure showed an increase in amplitude and duration, as well as an introduction of a plateau followed by a slower increase in amplitude below a critical transition temperature at 8 -10 degrees C. Neural recordings suggest that these findings may be due to both the introduction of two giant axon spikes at the transition temperature, as well as an increase in small fiber activity at lower temperatures. In free-swimming squid, these changes are manifested as a longer period of propulsive thrust which moves the squid a larger distance in a given time.

Despite their abundance, little information has been published about D. ornata. This study examined tube construction, locomotion, feeding habits, and activity patterns of D. ornata, and its ability to regenerate lost or damaged regions of its body. D. ornata construct elaborate sand and mucus tube caps that are anchored in the sand and arch over with the aperture ~1 cm above the sand and facing downward. Worms attach pieces of shell and drift kelp to the tube cap and can add on as much as 6 cm of new tube in one day. The portion of the tube that extends down into the substratum is more fragile and runs ~ horizontally at a depth of ~10 cm below the surface of the sand. The worms move up and down inside their tubes using parapodia and can turn around completely inside it. They can extend their bodies up to approximately 8 cm from the aperture of the their tube to retrieve food or tube building material, but can quickly withdraw by sudden muscle contraction. They were never observed to leave their tubes completely. When foraging, D. ornata sit at the aperture of their tube cap and undulate their 5 cephalic cirri rapidly. They appear to sense the presence of food nearby using chemoreception or touch. Time lapse video showed that the worms have distinct day-night patterns of activity, with feeding or working on the buried portion of their tubes as the primary diurnal activity, and repair or addition to the tube cap at night. Regeneration of a head appears to require anterior segments with gills; more posterior sections of the body died and deteriorated within 2 days. Sections maintained in natural or artificial tubes (plastic straws) appeared to survive longer, but did not show any signs of regeneration in 22 days. Further study is needed to more fully understand some of these behaviors and examine other behaviors, such as their reproduction.",,hms_mv823hk1731.tei.xml

The rate of ammonia excretion in this sedentary polychaete is relatively constant. 6. The ammonia content of aqueous gut contents is very low, which suggests that there is no enteronephric excretion. 7. The most probable sites of excretion are the tentacles and, to a lesser extent, the anterior body wall, which contains a single pair of large nephridia. This hypothesis is supported by biochemical assays done on the tissues, by behavioral studies, and by descriptive anatomy of the nephridia. 8.

Examination of the amino acid sequence of the SqKv1A channel thought to correspond to the axonal delayed rectifier K+ channel reveals a putative external DEPC target at histidine 351 (H351) near the pore. To examine the role of this residue in the DEPC effect, various Kv1 channels were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and tested for DEPC sensitivity. It was hypothesized that this histidine is necessary for the DEPC effect. Although it was found that K+ channels with the proposed critical residue exhibited a reduction in peak current after DEPC application, similar effects were seen in clones lacking the histidine near the external mouth of the pore. These cloned channels did have other external histidines, however. Additionally, DEPC slowed the activation kinetics of nearly all tested clones, in some cases without a corresponding decrease in current amplitude.

The total carotenoid content in the stalk fluid of Pollicipes was invariably lowest in animals close to point sources of pollution, concomitantly, the amount of carotenoid tended to increase with increasing distance from such pollution sources. 4. It was suggested that total carotenoid content may be effected by proximity to sewage effluent whereas astaxanthin content may be specifically effected by increased chlorine concentrations. 5.

Analysis showed that while feeding the peak instantaneous velocity obtained by the hatchling is twice as great and the peak acceleration is 50% greater than during an escape response to a strobe flash in which only the giant axon is used. Behavioral measurements of mantle radius made with video were used to compute jet thrust and compare performance with varying patterns of motor neuron activity in the restrained hatchling. The coordinated, adult like pattern of giant and small fiber use resulted in mantle contractions and jet thrusts that were always greater than contractions and thrusts produced by giant-only or small-only responses.

Two observations were significant: 1) the association between the gland and the bacteria might vary at different stages of sexual maturity, and 2) the morphology of the bacteria differed depending on the stage of development. Three hypotheses have been proposed that may explain the observed trends. The first suggests the varying association is a cyclic phenomenon during which the bacteria grow according to a characteristic lag, exponential, and stationary phase situation. The second explanation is that the gland secretes varying amounts of product during maturation which dictates the proximity of the bacteria to the gland.

However, wrack at different stages of can can have same moisture content. Therefore, no definite conclusions could be made in regard to succession in naturally occurring wrack. Yet, it was found that among wrack banks seemingly in the same general state of decay, great variation in species composition and species abundance may take place.

I. resecata has slightly greater abilities to deal with low oxygen situations, enabling it to cope with the low oxygen concentrations often found in Zostera beds.

Studies of the barnacles Balanus and Chthamalus show that smaller chthamaloids are able to persist in a larger range of habitats than balanoids because of their greater tolerance to physical stress and lower susceptibility to predation. I tested this model on the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus spp. at two sites in Monterey Bay which differed in wave exposure and abundance of the common predatory snail, Nucella emarginata. I ran lab experiments to determine prey preferences of N. emarginata, and then measured densities of both species of barnacles and of the whelk along transects in the field. B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. distributions were positively correlated, indicating that competition between the two species did not play an important role in determining distribution. Nested ANOVA's of barnacle densities revealed significant differences between sites and among replicate transects within each site for both species. Although whelks were abundant in the exposed site, they did not play a major role in determining barnacle abundance. Lab experiments showed that Nucella emarginata had a strong preference for B. glandula over Chthamalus spp. As this difference did not manifest itself in differential distributions in the field, I conclude that factors other than whelk predation alone regulate the distribution of these species. A strong recruitment event in spring 2001 of B. glandula enabled me to compare distributions of B. glandula adults and recruits. No strong difference was detected. The very high variance in barnacle density in both sites may indicate that barnacle distributions in Monterey Bay are regulated by multiple complex factors.

It was found that the population density increased linearly with an increasing amount of available shelter.

Possible major factors behind this phototaxis are visual predation and desiccation, and observations suggest that visual predation is primary. Leptasterias in shaded conditions tolerates exposure at low tide where there are no avian predators. The population at Pt. Pinos exhibits a high level of cryptic coloration which is proposed to result from visual predation. In the Hopkins Marine Station preserve, where populations of predators were highest, the stars occur in very low density. Food items of Leptasterias were examined at Pt. Pinos and under the Cannery and were found to be radically different both from each other and from previous work done in Puget Sound.

Many factors have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, including differential larval settlement, juvenile mortality, response to light, and, most commonly, predation pressure. I investigated the potential contribution of thermal stress on size gradient in a study area that has been shown to have very little predation on Tegula. I performed two types of experiments: temperature measurements of gelatin-filled snails and heat shock protein analysis of gill tissue from large and small snails that had been caged in the intertidal. Although my heat shock analysis was inconclusive, temperatures were consistently lower in small snails than in large snails, both in a controlled environment and in the field, a disparity possible caused by differences in the absorptivity of large and small snail shells. Heat shock protein analysis could verify that larger snails experience this increased heat stress.

At low tide, under conditions of exposure, Acanthina seeks the moisture of tidepools and A. elegantissima beds and remains relatively motionless. As the tide rises, activity increases and the snails crawl up onto the rocks and barnacles now washed or covered by the incoming tide. Feeding occurs according to the same pattern. The number of snails seen feeding increases as the tide rises and decreases and the tide falls. Of those snails feeding at low tide, a large proportion of them are feeding on prey caught during the previous high tide. 4) The field diet of Acanthina punctulata at Mussel Point includes the barnacles, Chthamalus spp. and Balanus glandula and the gastropods, Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata and Tegula funebralis. 5) Both field and laboratory observations on Acanthina punctulata indicate a hammering action of its tooth on the opercular opening of their barnacle prey.

This appears similar in many ways to the relationship established between the tropical anemone fish and their hosts. The hermit crabs go through a sequence of behavior in which they acquire a coating of mucus from contact with the anemone. The mucus is acquired through a series of behavioral steps exhibited by the crabs: poking, brushing, and stroking the anemone. Once acclimated, the crab freewalks among the tentacles feeding off of small food particles stuck to the Anthopleura and even removing food from the gut of its host.

Mytilus galloprovincialis, a blue mussel native to the Mediterranean, is a successful invader along the west coast of California, out-competing the native blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, over much of its range south of the San Francisco Bay. Previous research has studied cardiac function, enzyme biochemistry, and gene expression as factors that have led to M. galloprovincialis� successful invasion. Enzyme biochemistry, however, has only been studied in the laboratory, using specimens acclimated to common conditions. The objective of my study was to gain an accurate depiction of potential for metabolic function in field-acclimatized congeners of blue mussels collected from a site where both species and their hybrids occur. Estimates of potential metabolic rate were obtained by assaying the activity of two enzymes that are important in ATP production: malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS). Specimens were collected from Bodega Bay harbor, genotyped to their respected species (including hybrids), and enzyme assays were conducted. M. trossulus had a significantly higher activity for both MDH and CS, relative to M. galloprovincialis (one-way ANOVA tests). The hybrids' MDH and CS activities fell between those of M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis. To determine if size-dependence (�scaling�) of metabolic rate contributed to these differences, I used linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between body size (length of shell) and enzymatic activity. When all genotypes� MDH and CS activities and mussel size were compared, a significant negative correlation was evident. When the species were analyzed separately, however, the correlations were not significant. The higher activities of MDH and CS in M. trossulus are consistent with this congener being more cold-adapted (able to sustain a high metabolic rate at low temperatures) than the Mediterranean invasive. Furthermore, the hybrids are adapted to both warm and cold water, and can survive in a middle climate range. These data correlate to the mapped distributions of the genotypes along the California coast and to the previous knowledge of the physiological differences between the species.",,hms_sf268cs7826.tei.xml

TsTX-Ka is structurally similar to charybdotoxin, agitoxin-2, and other scorpion toxins that bind to the extracellular surface of the pore-forming region of Kv1-type (Shaker) channels. The action of TsTX-Ka was studied on squid K+ channels using the whole-cell patch clamp technique with dissociated giant fiber lobe (GFL) neurons and with inscet Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus carrying the cDNA for the corresponding channel (Brock et al., 1996). Under standard conditions (12 C, pH 7.6, 20 mM external K+), TsTX-Ka reduces Ik for a strong voltage step (+40 mV) in GFL neurons with an estimated Kd of 50 nM. Steady state voltage dependence and activation kinetics of residual Ik are minimally affected in 300 nM TsTX-Ka, but inactivation kinetics are accelerated. Similar results were obtained in SF9 cells. Block of Ik in GFL neurons by TsTX-ka (300 nM) depends on external pH. Less block occurs at low pH, with half-block occurring at pH 6.0, approximately the pKa of histidine (6.02). This amino acid is located in the SqKv1A channel (H351) at a position homologous to F425 in Shaker B, a residue critical to binding of charybdotoxin (Goldstein, et al., 1994) and agitoxin-2 (Gross & MacKinnon, 1996). These results suggest that H351 in the external mouth of the squid SqKv1A channel is also a determinant of TsTX-ka binding, and that protonation of the side chain of this residue may decrease toxin sensitivity by electrostatic repulsion.",,hms_wz914ym5348.tei.xml

The contractile force of the muscle layer at the base of the sea urchin spines was determined and found to significant in comparison to the resistive upon 10 degrees deflection offered by the spine ligaments when in a state of catch. A survey of a population of spines, both agitated and non-agitated, was conducted to obtain an objective definition of the state of catch vs. non-catch. An angular limit to deflection was found to exist for spines in catch, beyond which their ligaments would become irreversibly damaged. Experimental and mathematical calculation of Young's Modulus was done for a spine ligament in catch, and this was found to be similar to that given for vertebrate tendon at the same strain. The relationship between resistive force offered and angular deflection was examined, and it was found to be non-linear.

Limpets submerged for 4 hours between stresses exhibited weight gain during the experiment while 2 hours of submergence resulted in no significant weight changes. When limpets with a desiccation stress of 15% weight loss were allowed to equilibrate with sea water, a period of 2 hours was required for osmotic equilibration of the body fluid. More prolonged submergence of desiccated individuals results in an overshoot of weight recovery at osmotic equilibration.

Inhibitory activity was present in seawater homogenates of the algae at a concentration of approximately 2 mg fresh weight/ml. The inhibitory factor was heat stable and molecular sieve centrifuge filtration showed the active fraction had a molecular weight above 10,000. Comparison of the >10,000 MW fraction with fucoidan indicates that the inhibitor in the homogenate is not fucoidan or is not fuciodan alone. Sperm binding experiments showed that the factor(s) prevents sperm from penetrating the jelly layer of the eggs and possibly from penetrating the vitelline layer.

Selective agonists and antagonists were applied, and responsiveness was measured by a change in iridescence. Carbamylcholine and acetyl-beta-methyl-choline (AMBC) are group A muscarinic agonists that elicited positive response. Effective group B agonists included carbamyl-beta-methyl-choline (CMBC) and oxotremorine. Atropine, scopolamine, and pirenzipine are muscarinic antagonists that effectively hindered iridescence, while tubcurarine, a nicotinic antagonist, did not block iridescence. Agonist groupings are based on their ability to turn over phoshatidylinositol (Phl). The results of these agonists/antagonists combined with the effect of Li+ and subsequent addition of myo-inositol, show that Phl turnover may be involved. Li+ selectively inhibits a step in the Phl pathway. Li+ was found to decrease iridescence and addition of myo-inositol seemed to cause its reappearance. Ca++ seems to be involved, since addition of an agonist in zero Ca++ sea water did not result in iridescence.

Two experimental half-purse seine nets are the other type of gear used (spring, summer 1987). Squid egg cases were collected and then damaged with the assumption that gear net lead-lines drag across/through egg masses and potentially cause an increase in squid egg mortality. Egg cases traumatized mid-way through development experienced a higher estimated percentage of mortality (EPM) than those damaged at early or late stages, for low levels of damage (0 and .21 kg). Misdeveloped embryos occurred most frequently in these mid-stage egg cases. Higher levels of damage (1.2, 2.1, and 3.0 kg) resulted in significant increases of EPM for all three stages. Field work included an observation aboard one of the squid boats that had a half-purse-seine net. Pelagic organisms were 100% of this catch, suggesting that this net did not drag the bottom significantly during this particular set.

In addition, shells of C. limatula and C. pelta were tested for fatigue fracture by repeatedly loading the shells. All species save A. mitra showed increased force needed for fracture as shell thickness increased. No significant differences existed in force as a function of shell thickness among the species nor within each species for forces applied at the length and width of the scar and margin. However, shell size at the width of the scar was significantly smaller than at the other orientations for each species, suggesting that crabs could attack more shells at the scar width than at other places. Also, shells of C. limatula had significantly smaller widths at the scar than the other species, suggesting that perhaps more C. limatula shells are found fractured at the muscle scar because these smaller scar width shells are within the grasping rand of more crabs. Fatigue fracture proved significant (causing fracture below 200 cycles) at force loads above 60% of the predicted breaking force. Above 70-75% of predicted strengths, fracture required less than 50 cycles, indicating that within short time spans crabs could fracture shells without ever exerting a maximum force.

I also found that Oxylebius pictus, as well as other rock dwelling fish, will acclimate to Corynactis californica. The acclimation process takes approximately 3-5 days, depending on the amount of contact between the acclimating fish and the anemones, and the amount of previous contacts with the anemones by other fish. There are two mechanisms involved in the acclimation process. First, through repeated contact, the fish picks up mucus from the anemones and adds its to its own mucus layer. This causes each anemone to recognize the acclimated fish as a part of itself and prevents the fish from stimulating the anemone's chemoreceptors for nematocyst discharge.

Changes in behavior and neuronal firing patterns were monitored during the application of serotonin in order to elucidate how a neural circuit can be modified by a chemical transmitter. Behavioral observations indicate that micromolar concentrations of serotonin cause an increase in swimming frequency immediately after application in a whole animal preparation. Recordings from Interneuron 1 in the swimming circuit show that serotonin causes a decrease in burst duration and an increase in both instantaneous frequency and spikes/second/burst immediately upon application. These three parameters are all consistent with a transient acceleration and tightening of the burst firing pattern of Interneuron 1. After washout, a second application of serotonin to the same ganglia results in no significant changes in the firing pattern of Interneuron 1. Similar results were seen in a whole animal preparation; after 1-3 applications of serotonin no changes in swimming frequency occurred upon additional application. Two possible mechanisms are given to explain the effects of serotonin. One explanation is that serotonin works as hormones affecting all the cells within the swimming neural circuit.

This involves a specific G-protein second messenger cascade. The release of intracellular Ca2+ is preceded by a latent period of up to 30 seconds. This study investigated the contribution of IP3 diffusion and the dynamics of IP3 receptor activation to the latency between surface receptor binding and Ca2+ release. Intracellular injection of caged IP3 plus the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 was used investigate the basis of the observed latency. Following injection, cells were exposed to a brief (170ms) flash of light (230 joules, 360nm wavelength) to photolyse the caged compound. Fluorescence video imaging was used to follow the change in intracellular [Ca2+]. The study showed that [Ca2+] begins to rise immediately (within 200ms) following uncaging of IP3 by flash photolysis, and reaches maximum levels within 1.5 seconds. The result indicates that neither IP3 diffusion to its receptors nor delay between IP3R activation and Ca2+ release contribute significantly to overall latency. Analysis of Ca2+ wave kinetics shows that in contrast to cells stimulated with neurotransmitter, injected cells do not exhibit propagation of Ca2+ waves following photolysis of caged IP3. This observation suggests that the IP3 receptor is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the soma and major neurites. Ca2+ waves apparently travel through this IP3 receptor rich medium. The constant rate in which Ca2+ waves travel shows that propagation is an active process rather than a diffusional process.

We used a polyclonal anti-human GFAP in conjunction with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry techniques applied to optic lobes of the brain and to peripheral axial nerve cords in the arms. Animals were also studied before and after lesion to the axial nerves that contain ganglionic regions of neuronal and glial somata.

Substances produced by this strain increased the level of rhodamine accumulation in gill tissue and reduced the rate of rhodamine efflux when compared with a marine broth control. This strain was isolated separately from two different mussels collected more than seven weeks apart, indicating that it is endogenous to the mussel gut, either as a regularly ingested dietary bacteria or as a digestive symbiont.

Previous studies have shown that YS inhibits the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, and the active component responsible for this action is proposed to be a serotonin dimer derivative, 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine. Because serotonin is a crucial neurotransmitter in invertebrates, components of YS may also have an effect on the behaviour of neural networks where serotonin plays a role. Several lines of experiments were carried out to identify any possible relationships between the actions of these two compounds. Behavioural studies on the brittle star Ophiopteris papillosa, showed a similar response to both these compounds � immediate arm retraction. Results from these experiments established a biologically relevant concentration of YS for further testing. Control experiments carried out in Shaker potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that at this concentration, YS did not lead to a slowing of K-current activation. Additional experiments were performed using the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. B cells in this ganglia contain serotonin receptors and many of the cells and synaptic connections are modulated by serotonin. Single electrode recordings from B cells after application of serotonin demonstrated a marked increase in spontaneous activity (action potentials and post-synaptic potentials). Subsequent application of YS significantly decreased this activity, and further application of serotonin after YS had been washed away, renewed activity. This suggests that in the neural circuits involved in stimulation by serotonin, YS may function as an antagonist, and therefore Yellow Stuff may be acting in invertebrates via neuromodulatory pathways that involve serotonin.___",,hms_nn395kx7210.tei.xml

Cypris larvae of B. amphitrite were used to study the effects of the compound on larval chemotaxis, mobility, and settlement. Zosteric acid (ZA) elicited no chemotactic response from the larvae and therefore it does not appear to inhibit settlement by deterrence. ZA and sodium acetate, a weak acid with a similar pKa, did both cause larval immobility, possibly acting as weak acids and changing intracellular pH. Both pH neutralized (8.0) and unbuffered ZA were shown to inhibit settlement by up to 30%. Because the presence of microbial films can act as settlement cues for further fouling by both larval invertebrates and algae, ZA's effect on bacterial attachment was also investigated. Both zosteric acid, a sulfated phenolic ester, and p- coumaric acid, an unsulphated analog of ZA, were found to suppress bacterial attachment. Therefore, it can be concluded from this study that the sulphate moiety is not the necessary component for inhibiting bacterial adherence. The effects of ZA were also assayed on the attachment of sperm to the egg in the fertilization of the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Litichinus pictus. It was found that the sulphate group on the ZA is necessary for the inhibition of fertilization. Another fertilization experiment, in which Protease was used to remove the vitelline layer of the egg, showed that ZA may inhibit fertilization by binding to the egg receptors on the vitelline layer, thus blocking sperm from attaching.

The adequacy and availability of Tegula shells to P. samuelis and P. granosimanus was studied to investigate the possibility of competition for shells as a mechanism of maintaining tidal height segregation. The investigation was done in three portions: a mark and release study of live snails to directly find the rate of supply of new shells, creating a shell adequacy index using crab weight and shell diameter, and a comparison of the shell adequacy of P. samuelis and P. granosimanus where they co-occur and occur separately. Although the mark and release study yielded no mortality after six weeks, data from the shell adequacy index suggests that large P. samuelis and P. granosimanus are not shell limited.

The initial medium was then replaced by one with a differing calcium concentration, and the same series of shock was again administered. Cells exhibited a variety of responses to shock, but the most typical was a rapid contraction that grew stronger with increasing voltage. Switching the cells from LCM to HCM slightly increased contraction strength and slightly lowered the minimum voltage necessary to produce a twitch. Switching from high calcium to low had no discernable effect on contraction strength or threshold voltage. Likewise, the addition of tetrodotoxin until it reached a concentration of 200 nM also had no effect, regardless of the external calcium concentration. External calcium concentration in the culture medium strongly affected the cell mortality rate. Almost all cells (>90%) kept in HCM for 20 hrs were completely unresponsive to electrical stimulation.

They were however completely blocked by the addition of Ca++ to the inner face of the patch. An IPa3-gated ion channel with a conductance of 13 pS was observed that wad also not blocked by Mg++. There was also suggestion of two additional IP3 channels with larger conductances. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of cGMP- and IP3-gated ion channels in Pagurus olfactory receptor neurons. This dual signal transduction pathway, mediated by cGMP and IP3, may allow for the integration of a broader range of information representing a blend of odors.",,hms_kf965rg6064.tei.xml

These egg masses remain largely undisturbed by predation during the 30 days until embryo hatching. A reproductive gland of the adult female squid contains bacteria of predominantly one species which the female includes in the egg case during spawning. These bacteria are of the genus Shewenella, closely related to Shewenella putrefaciens, a putrefying marine bacteria which is characterized by the production of extremely large quantities of the polyamine putrescine. In this study, bacteria isolated from the squid gland and egg sheath were examined by HPLC to determine the quantity of putrescine. The bacteria contained amounts of putrescine comparable to S. putrefaciens. The possible role of the putrescine was then examined in a chemotactic response assay utilizing the starfish Pisaster ochraceus, a common predator at the depth of the egg masses. S. putrefaciens, the squid bacteria and a solution of putrescine were found to be significant deterrents to the P. ochraceus while a control strain, Vibrio harveyi, with low levels of putrescine showed no deterrence.

MDH and CS assays were conducted on foot, gill, mantle, and adductor tissues from both species. Calyptogena kilmeri was found to have lower CS activity and higher MDH activity than C. pacifica.

Studies in fishes have demonstrated that temperature changes cause differential expression of the two isozymes - thermostable and thermolabile - of malate dehydrogenase (MDH). These observations prompted me to determine MDH thermostability (ratio of thermostable to thermolabile isozymes) in tuna muscles along the temperature gradient. Contrary to expectation, MDH thermostability in red muscle appeared to decrease and in white muscle remained constant along the gradient from skin to core. MDH thermostability was consistently higher in white muscle than red muscle, possibly due to differential metabolic requirements of red and white muscle. Furthermore, citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and MDH activities were measured to determine whether they changed according to the thermal gradient.

Percent cover and vertical ranges were similar between the most exposed and intermediately exposed sites and much greater than at the most protected site. A discriminant function analysis of morphological data shows that the three populations may be objectively classified into three groups based on morphology. After a discriminant function analysis, it is possible to accurately predict the site of origination for most of the thalli examined. Patterns between the morphological data from the extremes of wave exposure suggest that plants at the most exposed location tend to break at lower internodes, producing a ""leggy"" and pruned morphology compared to those at the protected site. This pruning may serve to lower drag forces and hence be an adaptation to heavy wave exposure.

The absence of Petaloconchus in the diet was due to its low abundance in the habitat. The increased feeding on Balanus and Serpulorbis cannot be explained by changes in abundance, which were not statistically significant.

The species composition of the assemblage has changed little, but there has been a significant change in the relative abundances of species. Abundance of the bivalve, Musculus sp., has increased significantly, while that of the barnacle, B. glandula, has decreased.

This tubular rete, composed of bundles of arteries and veins, is small in area near the skin, but divides and widens as it nears the internal red muscle. The viscera is warmed by the supra-hepatic rete, a two-lobed tissue lying posterier to the heart and dorsal to the liver lobes.

In yellowfin tuna, blood analysis is complicated by stress responses to handling. These responses include changes in serum osmolarity, blood metabolites, and release of red blood cells from the spleen leading to increased hematocrit. Samples from stressed fish therefore do not accurately represent the resting health and physiology of an individual. This study presents a new method developed to minimize stress levels during blood sampling. Blood is drawn from the bulbus arteriosis of captive yellowfin tuna while the fish are still in the tank. Twenty-seven samples were taken from 18 individuals over the course of seven weeks. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts, ions, and metabolites were measured and compared to values obtained from fish sampled using other common techniques. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values were similar to those measured in chronically cannulated tuna, and lower than for fish sampled using a common practice of capture in a net (hematocrit 31.6%�0.8 vs.44.1%�8.5; hemoglobin 11.1 g/d1�0.3 vs. 17.0 g/d1�2.0). Creatine phosphokinase, potassium, and creatinine (all related to stress and/or increased muscle activity) significantly increased in net-sampled fish. Therefore, fish sampled using a bulbus puncture appear to be less stressed. Using this sampling technique, an experiment was run in which diet in one tank was changed from a normal 1% fat diet to a high 8% fat diet. Blood samples were taken before and after the 8% diet treatment. Serum free fatty acid concentrations doubled (0.25 mmol/L�0.03 vs. 0.524 mmol/L �0.03) in the 8% fat fed fish that were sampled.

The source of this excretion appears to be endogenous to C. canaliculatuam and does not come from its diet.

The flow of ions through membrane channels creates current and this changes the voltage across the cell membrane. These changes in voltage create the action potentials responsible for the propagation of neural signals. If the number of ion channels changes or the kinetics of individual channels change, the currents through the membrane will be altered and hence change the excitability the cell. Here I report changes in potassium conductance within the neurons of Doriopsilla albopunctata after treatment and recovery from a thirty-minute heat shock at 30� C. By using a voltage clamp, currents of individual cells were characterized. The cells were heat shocked and characterized again using the same stimulation regime. Significant increases in potassium conductance were observed within many, although not all, cells. In such cases, a novel current was found to be responsible for the change in potassium conductance. I conclude that heat shock affects either the expression of channels in the cell membrane or the kinetics of pre-existing ion channels, but only in some neurons. What cellular mechanism was responsible for this change and what specifically it changes, remains to be seen.",,hms_pd455zb7792.tei.xml

Cool, oxygenated blood from the gills can pass through the dividing vessels of this exchanger before reaching the brain or eyes. Since venous blood in the sinus flows opposite the arterial blood, counter-current heat exchange can occur. A vein originating in the red swimming muscle potentially contributes to the warmth of the venous sinus by supplying blood directly from the warmest part of the shark.

The larval period lasts just 12 days, during which there is rapid development of locomotion. At 12 days post fertilization (dpf), bonito undergo a rapid metamorphosis to the juvenile stage. The short, 12-day developmental period suggests rapid development and organization of the motoneuron and motor system. Swimming behavior was videotaped for five fish in each day, and analyzed by determining a time budget for active time and determining maximum body flexion exhibited by each fish. Motoneurons were fluorescently labeled with DiI and muscle activity was recorded using electromyography. Locomotion is initially produced using the trunk and develops to include use of the full tail and tip of the tail. Early in development, larval bonito spend the majority of their time inactive but sustained swimming periods become more common as the fish develops. Maximum body flexion did not appear to change with development. The number of motoneurons increased from less than 10 to over 30 cell bodies per segment. We also observed two types of motoneurons which differed in morphology. Cell bodies also appeared to develop in tiers until they were of the same size. Motoneuron development first took place in more rostral segments of the fish with the number and complexity of the motoneurons decreasing toward caudal segments. Signals obtained from EMG recordings appeared to correspond to the basic swimming modes of rapid bursts and longer duration swimming using tail beats. We cannot draw a direct correlation between swimming behavior, motoneuron anatomy, and muscle activity based on the data obtained thus far, however, we have shown that development of bonito swimming behavior is associated with rapid development of the motoneuron system and muscle activity which correlates to swimming mode.",,hms_vw383jj6666.tei.xml

Measurements taken after feeding of Bluefin implicate the caecum as the warmest visceral organ, however, little is known about the general anatomy of the tuna caecum or its method of heat production. Specimens of yellowfin, Thunnus albacares, and blackfin, Thunnus atlanticus, were used to study the anatomy, histology, and aerobic capacity of the tuna caecum. Anatomical comparisons were also made to the bonito, Sarda chiliensis, an ectothermic relative of the tuna. Injections of silicon into the caecum vasculature detected a parallel array of arteries and veins throughout the organ. Measurements of citrate synthase activity, an enzymatic indicator of tissue metabolic capacity, show a high degree of caecum metabolic activity, around 20 units/g tissue at 25 degrees C. This value is 4-5 fold greater than tuna white anaerobic muscle, but not as high as the aerobic red muscle. The high heat contribution from aerobic activity, along with that contributed by digestive processes within the caecum and stomach, may be able to account for much of the heat production within the viscera. The endothermic nature of the organ and the parallel architecture of the vasculature suggest that countercurrent heat exchange can occur. An increased visceral temp would lead to faster digestion and provide a continuous source of fuel for the tuna's high metabolic needs.",,hms_gy531ft4379.tei.xml

Motoneurons in the spinal cord from days 2 through 7 are organized into tiers: one tier was seen on days 2 and 3, two tiers on days 5 and 6, and three tiers on day 7. Tier distinction decreases as the fish grow older, and tiers are no longer distinguishable on day 11. Spinal cord cells are also divided into two categories - cells in pattern A tend to be larger and extend their axons ventrally to a fiber tract which travels parallel to the spinal cord and then veers to form the ventral root, while pattern B cells are smaller and extend their axons directly to their ventral root. Finally, neuritic connections between cells were seen in early days and multiplied with age. In later fish, extensive swellings were seen in the ventral roots and neurites of the spinal cord. Electrophysiology studies revealed that on day 7, the motor units of the fish began to fire in sustained low frequency series' reminiscent of the tail beat in continuous swimming.

Molecular crowding, resulting from high intracellular protein concentrations, has been shown to affect macromolecular function (Garner & Burg, 1994). To study this effect, the thermal stabilities of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoforms of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle, were studied under simulated in vivo conditions of high protein concentration. The mitochondrion contains much higher protein concentrations than those found in the cytoplasm; protein crystals have been used to model the mitochondrial matrix (Srere, 1981). The mitochondrial isoform of MDH (mMDH) showed substantial stability enhancement in media crowded with bovine serum albumin, a model protein. The cytoplasmic isoform (cMDH), which is more thermally stable than the mitochondrial isoform, exhibited no significant enhancement of stability in crowded media. This difference can be seen as an adaptation to local protein concentration. mMDH must be more flexible to function well in a more crowded medium, rendering it less thermally stable and more responsive to the stabilizing effects of a crowding agent. In order to study enzyme function, which is closely related to stability, apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km's) and Vmax's were determined in crowded and viscous conditions for the LDH of three species. The LDH of Parachaenichthys charcoti , an Antarctic fish, appears less susceptible to the effects of agents that slow enzyme function than two homologous enzymes from organisms that maintain a warmer body temperature. LDH from colder temperature organisms appears to be more flexible than LDH from organisms adapted to warm temperatures (Fields and Somero, in prep).

As a population, Ocenebra appear to be consuming prey proportional to its abundance in the field. This is consistent with a theory of random prey selection. However, snails marked and monitored over a five week period through 2 to 4 feeding cycles showed consistency in prey choice that differed from the population average. Prey items chosen by each individual were also consistent with a particular vertical zone in the intertidal. Ocenebra occur vertically from the subtidal to approximately +5 feet.

Marked snails remained within the vertical zone corresponding to their choice of prey at a much higher rate than would be expected if the individuals moved about randomly. Two possible conclusions are that Ocenebra stratify according to prey type in the vertical zone, or that Ocenebra stratify for non-foraging reasons. Evidence for the former is that in tanks with 4 types of prey items, all 8 individuals monitored throughout 3 to 5 feeding cycles chose prey consistent with a specific zone in the intertidal. This supports a correlation between zonation and prey choice in Ocenebra. This could imply that learning, conditioning, or genetic variation is present in Ocenebra circumtexta, and could lead to a competitive advantage over other predatory snails in the intertidal.",,hms_pc942zt0521.tei.xml

Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis), pelagic fishes belonging to the tuna family, undergo a relatively rapid developmental transformation in the <24-hour period after hatching. The two major morphological changes that occur are enlargement of the jaw and pigmentation of the eye (retinal ephithelium). In addition, dramatic behavioral changes take place. For example, early (stage L1) animals frequently exhibit fast start escape responses, while in the later stage (L2), more controlled sustained swimming movements are present. L1 larvae are also more sensitive to touch and vibration stimuli than L2. To test the hypothesis that the emerging visual system changes the activity of descending motor systems, I recorded field potentials in the hindbrain and spinal cord during this developmental period. Recordings of spontaneous activity showed that there was essentially no difference between L1 and L2 larvae, either in the light or dark. The same was true for L2 larvae reared in the dark. Looking at the strong visual stimuli, larvae reared in dark exhibit a movement response but recover more slowly than those reared under normal (daylight) conditions. This finding suggests that dark rearing negatively affects the sensitivity of the developing visual system, however appropriate connections with the hindbrain still appear to be made. Based on these observations, it appears that visual inputs might be sufficient to modify the activity of an identified reflex circuit, and more specific experiments are warranted to identify the physiological basis for this change.",,hms_fh264zc5541.tei.xml

Conotoxins have evolved for maximal effect on prey species hunted by each cone snail species (Duda and Palumbi, 1999). All cone snail venoms examined thus far contain peptides that act with great specificity on a variety of channels including K+, Na+, Ca2+, and ACh receptors (Olivera et al, 1999). Conus californicus is indigenous to the California coastline. Venom samples were collected by extruding the contents of one venom duct into 0.5 ml external recording solution and were further diluted during experiments. Voltage-depenent K+ currents were recorded from Shaker B K+ channels, in which both N- and C-type inactivation were eliminated, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. When applied to the bathing solution, the venom was found to induce rapid inactivation of Ik. K+ current was reduced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that fits satisfactorily with a simple model of open-channel block that applies to tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium (QA) that block K+ channels at the inner mouth of the channel, but only after the channel has opened following a voltage step. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the venom acting on the external side of the membrane. First, the venom interacts with externally applied tetraethylammonium (TEA). an impermeant QA. An internal blocker would be expected to be unaffected by external TEA. Second, recovery from venom-induced Ik block is similar to that from QA-block in its dependence on voltage, but different from QA in that recovery shows no acceleration in solutions with elevated external K= concentration. Lack of this effect suggests that the venom component in question is not acting to block internally, because it cannot be dislodged by inward Ik negative voltages. Third, channel-blocking action was preserved following dialysis of the venom at a 3500-molecular weight cut off. This suggests a large molecule such as a peptide is the active component.",,hms_qm940yy4890.tei.xml

Sixty-three percent of Crepidula are found alone on Tegula shells, while 37% of Crepidula are on Tegula that are host to at least one other Crepidula as well. Initial lab experiments to determine movement rate of Crepidula between hosts showed that 16% of Crepidula moved at least once, 100% of whom were male. Experiments were then set up to determine what motivated male Crepidula to move. Males were removed from their original hosts and reattached on new hosts, then placed in replicate tanks containing Tegula with either no Crepidula or specific combinations of male and/or female Crepidula. Results of 19 replicates show that on average, 48% of Crepidula movements were to Tegula containing female Crepidula, 33% were to Tegula containing no Crepidula, and only 12% were to Tegula containing only male Crepidula.

The fidelity of the two stocks to their respective breeding ground is currently in question. In the Gulf of Mexico, bluefin arrive in a sexually inactive state and in some time period ranging from weeks to months, develop into spawners. This western stock is reported to mature at about 190-205 cm in length and about 8-10 years of age. Currently, bluefin tuna are being tagged with pop-up satellite and archival tags, to discern their migratory movements and philopatry to a spawning ground. My objective was to examine bluefin in the areas they are currently being tagged, to discern the state of sexual maturity of fish in the different regions. Specifically, I was interested in identifying 1) what is the minimum size of first sexual activity and 2) if spawners were restricted only to the Gulf of Mexico. Knowing which fish are mature will help to interpret the movement and behaviors revealed by the tag data. Since scombrid fishes are closely related, other species provided a valuable comparison. To histologically identify the stages of wild caught bluefin tuna I compared the tissues to yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) held in captivity at the Tuna Research and Conservation Center. Based on a classification system from previous studies, I assigned each sample a stage of maturity. In addition, for captive fish, I collected data on gonad size at mortality, which provided an index of gonad development for corroboration with histological examinations. I found that female yellowfin tuna do not become sexually active in water temperatures below 20 degrees C, but male yellowfin do, with no apparent variation in size to first sexual maturity from wild caught yellowfin tuna. Female yellowfin at 25 degrees C showed slightly more advanced oocytes than females at 20 degrees C. Both sexes of bonito become mature in captivity and spawn in 20 degrees C water. Together, histological observations of the captive populations reveal all the stages of gonadal development needed to classify scombrid gonad samples. Based on comparative histological analyses, I concluded that all bluefin gonadal tissues (n=111) from New England and North Carolina were inactive and therefore not spawning. All fish from the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas (n=5) demonstrated asynchronous ovaries with many oocytes yolked and in maturation stages just prior to spawning. The lack of a fully hydrated oocyte, indicative of a currently spawning fish is probably due to the small sample size and time of capture. The Bahama fish represent the first histological observations of sexually active bluefin tuna outside the Gulf of Mexico. Understanding the reproductive biology and the size at first spawning is a crucial step for developing future management strategies.",,hms_fz579hz2608.tei.xml

Previous work has resulted in the cultivation, isolation, and characterization of two dominant bacterial strains (genera Shewanella and Roseobacter) from homogenates of egg case sheath and accessory nidamental gland. QUESTIONS Do these cultivated isolates accurately represent the diversity of the sheath bacterial community? Are there bacteria present in the sheaths that are not cultivatable and therefore have not been described or characterized? What are the numbers of bacteria in the sheaths and what percent of these can be cultured? RESULTS In order to obtain release of the bacteria from the sheath for quantitative enumeration, a means of disrupting the tough egg sheath was developed using sodium periodate and glass beads. Total bacterial counts ranged between 10(8) and 10(9) bacterial per sheath which is slightly higher than the 10(6) to 10(8) estimated by Biggs and Epel (1991) with electron microscopy. A live/dead staining assay with DAPI and propidium iodide indicated about 68% of bacteria in sheath homogenate were alive. Serial dilutions of the native sheath homogenate were plated on various culture media and colony forming units were counted. Using comparison of direct bacterial counts from the homogenate, the viability stain, and the number of colony forming units on plates, the percent of bacteria cultivatable was found to be between 30 and 50%.

One of the more prevalent PPCPs is a perfume ingredient, musk ketone (1-tert.-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-4-acetylbenzene). I tested musk ketone for its ability to modulate the accumulation and efflux of xenobiotics known to be substrates of the multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter using Corbicula fluminea, Lytechinus pictus, Mytilus californianus, and Mytilus edulis. The multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter (MXR) is a functional homologue of the mammalian multi-drug resistant transporter (MDR), a P-glycoprotein. In aquatic systems, MXR serves as a first line of defense against an array of lipophilic compounds. Musk ketone increased the accumulation of the MXR substrate rhodamine B in L. pictus embryos, and M. californianus gill tissue; initial testing implicated accumulation of rhodamine B in C. fluminea. Musk ketone increased the toxicity of vinblastine-- a MXR substrate that inhibits microtubule formation--in L. pictus, but not in M. edulis embryos. However, musk ketone did not definitely slow the efflux of rhodamine B from L. Pictus and M. californianus suggesting that this chemical is not acting as a classical MXR inhibitor.

Using microelectrode techniques, I measured resting potentials and action potentials in the MCC (metacerebral cell) in the cerebral ganglion of Aplysia californica.

The second component of potassium current resembled a delayed rectifier and exhibited slow and incomplete inactivation, with peak current occurring within 5 or 6 milliseconds for large depolarizations and partial inactivation over the much longer period of about 150 milliseconds. The kinetic properties of each individual current were analyzed and described and a model based on Hodgkin-Huxley was used to compute conductance time course as a function of voltage.",,hms_jk623zz7955.tei.xml

Mussels high in the zone spend less time exposed to normoxic conditions as a result of longer emersion periods. They also experience greater temperature fluctuations. Such abiotic stresses were expected to make metabolic rates among high and low mussels different. Respiration (O2 consumption) and malate dehydrogenase activities of gill tissue were used as indicators of metabolism. The design of this experiment led to mussel acclimation over a period of 25 days. When plotted against time, enzyme activities of low mussels showed a significant (p = 0.048) decrease in activity. Additionally, a significant (p = 0.014) decrease was observed in O2 consumption of high mussels. The unexpectedly rapid physiological plasticity shown by M. californianus resulted in small sample sizes (enzyme n = 10, respiration n = 4) of freshly collected individuals, which may have contributed to the non-significant differences seen in high and low mussel MDH activities (p = 0.059) and respiration rates (p = 0.74).

Based on their ability to function at such different temperatures, their nervous systems must compensate to accommodate the environmental changes, either in order to keep behavior the same or to change the animal's behavior in favor of homeostasis. To look at how a nervous system behaves at different temperatures, isolated ganglia from the yellow dorid nudibranch, Doriopsilla albopunctata, were exposed to temperature ranges simulating those of the intertidal zone (10 to 25 degrees Celsius). Single electrode intracellular recordings were taken to study the behavior of individual neurons. Variation in spontaneous activity, firing frequency, utilization time and synaptic potentials revealed individualistic, non-uniform responses to temperature on the neural level. The data suggest that neurons in Doriopsilla albopunctata are not individually temperature compensated, and therefore temperature compensation does not happen on the neuronal level. Nor do the data show that all nerve cells respond to temperature the same way.

The voltage-independence of cephalopod Na+ channel kinetics is hypothesized to be important in mediating fast escape and swimming behavior. Analysis of kinetic parameters of Strombus sodium currents was performed in order to ascertain whether the voltage-dependence of their activation and inactivation rates deviate from those of slower gastropods and resemble those of cephalopods.

O. glauca larvae consume the barnacle, Balanus glandula, and use the shell for protection and pupation. The percent of barnacles infested with larvae and pupae was greatest in a high-intertidal crevice (29%), moderate on upper north-facing intertidal walls (~3%), and zero at lower tidal heights and on south-facing walls. Thermal stress, high salinity, and submergence are physiological stresses imposed on the larvae and pupae due to life in the intertidal zone. In laboratory tests of thermal tolerance, all larvae died following 3 hours of exposure to 39 degrees C, but tolerated temperatures less than or equal to 38 degrees C. Pupae appeared more sensitive to thermal stress, with 0% eclosion by pupae treated at 35 degrees C, 38 degrees C, and 41 degrees C for four hours. Intertidal datalogger records and field measurements of internal B. glandula temperatures exceeded 36 degrees C, near the thermal limit of O. glauca larvae. In addition to this thermal stress, during periods of aerial exposure, B. glandula was significantly more saline in vivo than the surrounding seawater, perhaps due to evaporative cooling by the barnacle. In tests of submergence tolerance, larvae survived 8 days of submergence in filtered seawater held at 13 degrees C, but all died after 10 days. The pupae were apparently more sensitive to submergence; 40% of pupae submerged for two hours enclosed within 16 days, whereas there was only 12.5% eclosion of pupae submerged for 24 hours. The larvae were observed not to respire during six hours of submergence. However, the larvae respired at a rate of 0.4317 �mol O2/hr/g, over four days of submergence.

Differences in maximal temperature and emersion time for each species are associated with their individual vertical zonation. The thermal stability of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a homogenate supernatant from P. cinctipes is greater than that from P. manimaculis. Purification of LDH removes this difference, causing the thermal stability of purified LDH from P. cinctipes to decrease to that of P. manimaculis. Thus some extrinsic factor may influence the proteins' thermal stability. To determine whether the enzyme thermal stability could be altered, I acclimated crabs to various conditions of temperature and emersion. Temperature rose between 8-15 degrees C above ambient seawater temperature during the 5.5 hour emersion time in one treatment, but did not change in the constantly immersed treatment. High levels of mortality were only observed for P. manimaculis in the emersion treatment. Thermal stabilities of LDH in homogenate supernatants did not change over a 36 day acclimation period.

Mammals, birds, tuna and squid all maintain high metabolic rates. Elevated metabolic rates demand high cardiac output. How the heart evolves the cellular machinery to deliver a high cardiac output remains unexplored. Tunas are exceptional amongst bony fishes in being endothermic. They maintain a high metabolic rate over a wide range of ambient temperatures. Bluefin tuna have been recorded to swim in ambient temperatures as low of 2.8� C. In cold waters, tuna maintain high temperatures in their muscles through a highly vascularized countercurrent heat exchange system. However, their heart temperatures are exposed to ambient temperatures. Tuna hearts deliver high cardiac outputs, high frequency contractions, and high power outputs in a wide range of temperatures. This project examined the mechanisms that allow tuna to produce their high cardiac outputs at the cellular level. In this project I investigated the importance of increased dependence on calcium cycling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in tuna hearts. The presence of calcium ATPase and the SR calcium release channel were examined using biochemical purification of the SR membrane. The proteins are required to release and take up calcium from the cytoplasm into the SR during contraction and relaxation of the heart. SR protein was purified in wild yellowfin and bluefin tuna hearts. The SR preparation was separated on 7.5% and 3-12% gradient SDS gels. The Serca 2 pump was visualized using a Comassie blue stain of the gels and an antibody specific to Serca 2 on Western blots. Both gels and blots indicate that yellowfin and bluefin atria and ventricles have the calcium ATPase and ryanodine receptors. Densitometry using NIH Image suggests higher levels of Serca 2 in the atria than ventricles in both tuna. A functional assay of calcium uptake was performed on SR vesicles using a calcium-sensitive dye, Fura 2, in a spectroflourophotometer. Preliminary results indicate similar rates of SR calcium uptake between yellowfin and bluefin tuna and between tuna atria and ventricles.

For example, the temperate snail Conus californicus produces a novel conotoxin that targets voltage-sensitive sodium channels in cephalopod, but not gastropod neurons. The predicted molecular weight from the cDNA sequence encoding this peptide is 4680 Da. Numerous dense granules appear in the venom duct of Conus californicus, where venom production occurs. In an attempt to isolate the granules, as a first step towards biochemical characterization, crude venom was run on a Ficoll-sucrose gradient. Inspection of these granules with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of dense granules of approximately 2-6 �m in diameter. Electrophoresis of the SDS solubilized granules revealed a prominent 5 kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide tricine gels that matches a band in ""milked"" venom and duct venom. This 5 kDa granule peptide was not solubilized by nonionic detergent (NP40) suggesting that it is packed within a tightly associated granule complex. Observation with light microscopy indicated that application of heat disintegrated the granules and released soluble, bio-active peptide into the medium. Preliminary whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of disassociated cells from the stellate ganglion of Sepia officinalis showed that the granule contents block voltage-gated sodium channels.

Research on other barnacle species suggests that a variety of factors, particularly whelk predation and temperature stress may influence the nature of this morphological variation. By sampling T. squamosa rubescens in several sites in Monterey and Pacific Grove, California, we established that barnacle morphology varies significantly with respect to location and the vertical orientation of the substrate. One of the major aspects that differed between locations is whelk predation and the vertical orientation of the barnacles' substrate. Barnacles are taller on vertical substrate, and barnacles in areas of high whelk predation have more enclosed, recessed opercular plates. By exposing whelks to barnacles with artificially exposed opercular plates in caged experimental treatments, we found that the whelks preferentially prey on barnacles with exposed opercular plates. Our predation field experiment corroborates the field sampling data insofar as the exposure of the opercular plates decreases with increased whelk abundance, and decreased exposure of the opercular plates significantly decreases the risk of whelk predation. Moreover, by measuring the heat flux through barnacles with different shapes, we ascertained a significant difference in the temperature budgets of taller, narrower barnacles versus barnacles with a shorter, broader shape. It appears that barnacles with tall, narrow shells shed heat to the air more rapidly.

A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on frequency of movement, with degree of splash and field site as the two factors. Data from during the day and at night had to be analyzed separately because all possible combinations of ""splash"", ""site"" and ""light level"" did not occur during my field study. Frequency of movement did not differ significantly among sites. No movement was observed at low tide in either the lab or field. An increased frequency of movement was found to accompany a corresponding increase in splash level, both at night and during the day. However, lab results showed a decreased frequency of movement when limpets were submerged rather than sprinkled by a spray bar. A significantly greater amount of movement (25%) was seen at night than during the day (7%) � a finding that could be due to the higher nighttime tidal heights. Lab results showed no significant difference in day and night movement frequency. In a separate experiment, limpets were exposed to an artificial high tide, during a normally low tidal period. The limpets responded by producing a significantly lower-than-normal frequency of movement (8%). 10/15 tidal simulations resulted in a movement frequency of zero.

It is of concern since after spring rains and by leeching processes, atrazine and its breakdown products (considered equally as toxic) enter water supplies, streams, and other major bodies of water. It reaches levels in community water systems up to 89 ppb, in river basins up to 131 ppb, in drinking water up to 12 ppb, and even in rainfall up to 40 ppb. Atrazine alters neuroendocrine function, causes mammary tumors in rats, and a recent study showed demasculation and hermaphroditism in frogs at concentrations as low as 1 ppb. The high levels of atrazine in aquatic environments due to agricultural runoff, coupled with the significant effects of atrazine on the MXR mechanism raises concern over the health of other marine organisms. Atrazine's inhibition of the MXR substrate potentially could allow other toxic or carcinogenic agents to enter cells and adversely affect the health of marine communities.",,hms_bn573hk3494.tei.xml

Studies were carried out with individual radular teeth that defined the pressure-flow characteristics in order to estimate the pressure used by a snail to eject venom during prey capture. Pressure and flow were directly proportional over the range of investigated pressures (up to 4 cm Hg) and flow rates (up to 2 �l s-1). Behavioral observations of prey capture were carried out with C. catus, a closely related species that employs similar toxins. Video data revealed the approximate duration of venom injection to be about 100 ms. The duration of venom injection by C. striatus is probably similar, and the volume of ejected venom in this species can be 20 �l or more based on �milking� trials.

GFP lipofection of brain cross-slices indicated that at least some of these cells are dividing much of the time. We developed a novel procedure for the isolation of PVC cells and demonstrated growth of neurospheres in culture from these progenitors when driven under various growth factors (Insulin, IGF, Retinoic acid, bFGF).

A monoclonal antibody to 5-bromo-2�-deoxyuridine (BrdU) permitted visualization of those cells that incorporated the nucleotide into DNA during S phase of mitosis. IGF I significantly stimulated neural progenitor cell proliferation across all brain regions investigated. bFGF significantly stimulated mitogenic activity in the dorsomedial optic tectum, torus longitudinalus, and thalamic nucleii, but inhibited cell proliferation in the periventricular hypothalamus. NGF did not stimulate cell proliferation in any of the brain regions tested. The anatomical locations of high proliferative cell density were investigated in vivo by exposing adult zebrafish to BrdU in the ambient water for 24 hours. High densities of dividing cells were found in the outer surface of the optic tectum, the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum, the torus longitudinalus, the thalamic nucleii, the periventricular hypothalamus, the outer surface of the forebrain, and throughout the cerebellum.

For example, Lottia giagantea is positively correlated with wave force, but shows no correlation with temperature, azimuth and altitude angles, or the presence of crevices in the rocks.

Understanding the divisions between populations of organisms is important to fishery regulations and designing effective marine reserves. Tegula funebralis have a pelagic larval phase, lasting 5-14 days, giving them a moderate potential for dispersal. Samples ranging from Oregon to Santa Barbara were collected from seven geographic locations. A 700 base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was sequenced for an average of 9 individuals from each location. Comparing these sequences, there is no clear overall population structure, although there seem to be some slight patterns corresponding to geographic location. In particular, snails from Oregon are more similar to each other and are more different from snails from other populations, suggesting a lower level of dispersal between T. funebralis from Oregon and the more southern locations. These smaller signals could not be shown to be significant with the current sample sizes, using FST values or chi-squared tests, and had p values of between 0.07 and 0.10. Overall, there appears to be a fairly high level of gene flow across the range studied, which makes it unlikely that there are major barriers to dispersal in this range.

Seventy individual whelks were marked and observed at each day-time low tide over a 3 week period at 2 wave protected sites at Hopkins Marine Station. Temperatures ranged from <15� C on cold, overcast days to >30� C on calm, sunny days. Temperatures of sun-exposed regions of each site averaged 7.5� C warmer than sun-protected regions, with the greatest differences on the warmest days. Most larger prey of N. emarginata (Balanus glandula and Mytilus californianus) were more abundant is sun-exposed regions while smaller prey species (Chthamalus spp.) were more abundant is sun-protected areas. Proportions of marked whelks that were feeding varied widely between 5 and 68% on days when exposed temperature was below 28� C. Above 28� C, however, percent feeding never exceeded 10% and declined as temperatures rose higher. Whelks that remained feeding in sun exposed areas at the higher temperatures fed predominately on larger, more valuable prey that can take several days to drill and consume, thus experiencing greater potential thermal stress. Whelks transplanted to a nearby site traveled farther than control whelks and sought appropriate shelter before the next low tide (avg. temp = 31.2� C). They remained more sedentary than controls for the week following transplant, after which they resumed foraging similar to the controls. These results suggest that N. emarginata is conservative in its response to high temperatures during low tide. The response does, however, limit the time available for feeding on larger prey. Consistently warmer temperatures could serve to shift the preferred prey species.",,hms_hp315qb1561.tei.xml

Neurogenesis in the ventricular zones implies that the cells are turning over and remaining progenitor cells; however this study examines whether these cells are differentiating.

In this study, the thermal limits of heart function were determined for three congeneric marine snail species of the genus Tegula, all inhabiting discrete vertical zones in the intertidal. T. funebralis is found in the low- to mid-intertidal, T. brunnea in the subtidal to low-intertidal, and T. montereyi in the subtidal zone. Using impedance electrodes, changes in heart rate were monitored in field-acclimatized and lab-acclimated specimens of each species, in response to thermal stresses in water. Significant interspecific differences in Arrhenius break temperature values (ABT, the temperature at which heart rate began a sharp decline) were observed. Average ABTs for field-acclimatized T. funebralis, T. brunnea, and T. montereyi were 31�C, 25�C and 24�C, respectively, establishing a positive correlation between cardiac upper thermal tolerance limits and maximum habitat temperatures. Flatline temperatures, defined as those at which hearts ceased to beat, followed the same trend�T. funebralis hearts stopped beating at significantly higher temperatures than the two subtidal species. In response to cold stress, T. funebralis maintained cardiac function at lower temperatures than its congeners, demonstrating that it is more eurythermal. In all three species, ABTs of specimens lab-acclimated to 22�C were higher than those of 14�C lab-acclimated snails. T. funebralis, however, showed the smallest ABT difference between acclimation temperatures, indicating that it may have a lower capacity for thermal acclimation. The results of this study suggest that the mid-intertidal species T. funebralis is living closer to its upper thermal tolerance limits. Thus T. funebralis populations, and perhaps warm-adapted intertidal species in general, may be at highest risk in the event of global climate change.",,hms_gg717gf4801.tei.xml

One of the most important of these is the pressure drag generated by crashing waves, the magnitude of which is determined by the interaction of water velocity and an alga�s projected area. This study addresses the effects of increasing drag on the properties of the common intertidal red alga Mastocarpus papillatus. Breaking force of the stipe is positively correlated with drag, indicating morphological and/or mechanical differences between exposed and protected individuals of this species. Contrary to preliminary work by Carrington (1990), stipe cross-sectional area and material strength are both positively correlated with drag as well as with breaking force, suggesting that an individual blade may be adjusting both of these parameters in response to its mechanical environment. A single blade does not, however, appear to increase both of these factors simultaneously, as stipe cross-sectional area and strength are negatively correlated. Thus I find that M. papillatus may respond to increased drag by either increasing its stipe diameter or its tissue strength but not both together.

To find out how stress affects adult neurogenesis in the zebrafish, we subjected zebrafish to acute or chronic predator stress and assessed the proliferation of newly born cells in the optic tectum and cerebellum. These regions are known to have measurable rates of cell proliferation. Stereologic analyses of the number of 5-bromo-2� deoxyuridine (BrdU) �labeled cells revealed that 1 exposure of zebrafish to a predator (acute stress) did not change cell proliferation in the optic tectum or the cerebellum. However, three day repeated predator stress (chronic stress) significantly reduced cell proliferation, by 37% in the optic tectum, while having no significant effect in the cerebellum. A comparison between non-stressed zebrafish optic tectum and cerebellum revealed no significant regional difference in cell proliferation rate. These findings suggest that stressful experiences may down-regulate adult neurogenesis in certain regions of the zebrafish brain, similar to stress induced neurogenesis effects in mammals and birds.

These levels were compared to control levels of Hsps recorded in snails not exposed to any cold treatment. In snails facing 10-hour exposure times, levels of Hsp 72 remained constant or decreased slightly relative to the control levels after 2 hours of recovery, while Hsp 72 levels after 10 hours of recovery were significantly lower than the control values. In contrast, levels of Hsp 72 expression in snails exposed for only 2 hours were not significantly different from control values after 10 hours of recovery.

What is the thermal tolerance of Lottia digitalis, and how often do they see these body temperatures? The lethal temperature limits of L. digitalis were found, in air, to vary depending on length of exposure time. At ten minutes of heat exposure, limpet survivorship (tested 24 hours after exposure) declined from 100% to 0% as temperature increased from 41 to 45� Celsius.

A heat budget is a mathematical model that predicts the body temperature of an organism, based on records of past environmental conditions plus physical characteristics of the organism. A comparison between the heat extremes predicted by the heat-budget model and the thermal limits showed that L. digitalis approaches within 5� C of its thermal limit once every 12 years (on average).

Each protein substrate is covalently tagged by several 76-amino acid ubiquitin molecules; the tagged protein is degraded by the 26S proteasome complex, releasing free ubiquitin. Deubiquitinating enzymes regulate the generation and recycling of ubiquitin levels in the cell. This field study examined trends in ubiquitin-conjugate levels in Anthopleura elegantissima in order to determine whether overall changes in ubiquitin-conjugate levels are detectable and significant and also to observe the timescale of any such cycles of conjugate build-up and clearing. Levels of ubiquitin-conjugates in the field in A. elegantissima were examined every four hours over a four day period at two sites by Western blots and dot blots using an anti-ubiquitin-conjugate antibody (Lars Tomanek, Somero Lab). Mean pooled intensities of dot blot wells revealed occasional clearing of ubiquitin conjugates over the collection period with no difference between the two sites, suggesting that at some time points, all detectable ubiquitin must be in its free form or itself been degraded. Time series analysis revealed no significant predictive factors that correlated to ubiquitin-conjugate levels. Factors examined were exposure to sun, presence of rain, immersion/emersion conditions prior to and at the time of sampling, extrapolated tidal height, time of day, and anemone body temperature.",,hms_ty809dq3637.tei.xml

Such a plethora of functions also reflect diverse permeability to ions. In this study, the specific member TRPM7 is tested to understand its role in calcium regulation. As an initial test of the possibility that TRPM7 channels contribute to regulation of Ca2+ influx, [Ca2+]i was measured by the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-3-AM, using confocal laser microscopy. In cells in which TRPM7 channel expression was induced and the cells were perfused with Ca2+ - free solution, restoration of extracellular Ca2+ (2mM) caused marked increases in [Ca2+]i; whereas non-induced cells did not show much change in [Ca2+]i. From the proportion of Ca2+ that is taken into the cell, it is plausible that TRPM7 is a vital mode of Ca2+ entry. a second test looked at the effects of Gd3+ (20uM) on Ca2+ influx. The introduction Gd2+ quenched fluo-3 fluorescence, indicating that Gd3+ blocked conductance of Ca2+ through the TRPM7 channel. A final experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of adding Mg2+. Results indicate that the addition of extracellular Mg2+ (2mM) reduces Ca2+ influx. This shows an interaction of both internal and external Mg2+ in the regulation of TRPMY in clocking Ca2+ influx and in allowing Mg2+ influx.

Confocal laser microscopy and the indicator dye fluo-3/AM allowed for visualization of intra cellular Ca2+ in response to changes in external Ca2+, indicating that TRPM7 functions as a calcium channel under physiologically appropriate conditions. Our results also indicated that Mg2+ interferes with the movement of Ca2+ through the TRPM7 channel. The data further suggest that the percent of TRPM7 channels blocked by Mg2+ is proportional to the extracellular Mg2+ concentration.

I investigated the effects of cAMP on intracellular calcium concentrations using HEK-293 cells as a study system. Changes in internal Ca++ concentration were monitored using the fluorescent indicators fluo-3 and fura-2 and both conventional and confocal microscopy. First, cAMP was found to potentiate calcium influx through TRPM7 in cells induced to express the channel. Second, a novel cAMP-induced oscillatory response was observed in both M7-expressing and control cells. Treatment with cyclic GMP did not elicit the oscillatory response. The oscillations persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca++ and were blocked by pretreatment with 1uM thapsigargin, indicating they are solely dependent on the release and reuptake of calcium from internal stores. Oscillations continued in the presence of 10uM ryanodine but were blocked by 100uM 2-APB, suggesting a central role for the IP3 receptor and not the ryanodine receptor. Treatment with the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine yielded mixed results. Oscillations persisted in some cells but were more prolonged and less frequent.

In this study, behavioral and electrophysiological responses to the looming stimulus were measured by differential suction electrodes at the optic tectum and retinal ganglion cells of adult male zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). The looming stimulus was simulated by a light-emitting diode and by increasing irradiance durations. Responses to off-light events were found at both the retina and optic tectum, suggesting that light-induced startle responses begin as early in the visual synaptic pathway as the retina. However, several differences in signal shape and amplitude between recordings at these two regions suggest that higher-order visual processing of on- and off-responses occurs at the optic tectum. Latency times were measured between the presentation of the stimulus and the onset of the response, but data are currently inconclusive. Habituation was observed through decreases in startle response as a function of flash repetition.

A. sola samples were collected at six sites from Monterey Bay to San Diego, California. Analysis of the chloroplast 23s ribosomal RNA gene showed three distinct types of Symbiodinium (types I, II, III).

Previous studies have suggested that this sudden drop in heart rate may be triggered by a behavioral adaptation to environmental stress, valve closure. This behavior would lower the amount of oxygen available for aerobic metabolism, which could necessitate a decrease in cardiac activity. My study examined the temporal patterns of heart rate and relative valve position (open versus closed) in specimens of ribbed mussel (Mytilus californianus) exposed to controlled heating in water. Heart rate data and valve motion were gathered using, respectively, impedance electrodes inserted into the pericardial space and Hall-effect sensors attached to the mussel valves. The mussels were monitored over the course of a 2.7 hour period, during which water temperature was increased from 14� C to 34� C. On average valves were more closed after Hcrit than before (P< 0.0001). However, valve closure began prior to Hcrit, and the mussels reached their most closed position after Hcrit had been surpassed. Thus there was no evidence that complete valve closure occurred before heart rate decline. Therefore, the fall in heart rate above Hcrit cannot be ascribed to a simple behavioral response, complete value closure. Future studies should quantify the responses of valve movement to other factors, such as decreasing water salinity and emersion effects, that are also linked to changes in mussel heart rates to gain further insight into the relationship between valve movement and heart function.",,hms_zq716hn7310.tei.xml

Recollection of a memory requires that the memory pathway is strengthened by continual re-visitation. This re-visitation requires the activation of _-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, two important signalers in the fight-or-flight stress response. Propranolol blocks this activation and thus prevents the strengthening of memory pathways. Most previous studies have utilized either human or rodent study subjects. Zebra fish provide a unique opportunity to examine an organism with a different scale of neuro-complexity and a more accessible genome, which could eventually lead to a greater understanding of how the _-receptor memory coupling functions. The fish (Danio rerio) were trained to associate tapping on the glass of their aquarium with a positive (Tap+Food), negative (Tap+Net), or neutral experience (Tap). The control fish (No Tap) were not exposed to tapping during the three week training process. After re-activation of the memory, propranolol was dissolved in the water for an overall concentration of 27_M. The anxiety levels and memory retention of the fish were then tested after 1, 2, 3 and 18 hours. Preliminary data suggest that propranolol has a clear impact on the anxiety levels of the negative, neutral and control fish and may have some impact on the positive fish. Additionally, propranolol decreases the clarity and accuracy of spatial memory in fish trained using positive reinforcement. This study demonstrates that _-receptors and memory recall are tightly coupled throughout evolution, despite differences in neuro-complexity.

Urchins fed diets of both sporophylls and apical meristems experienced the least growth, as sporopyll and apical meristem tissue palatability was low, due to either low nutrient levels (sporophylls) or high polyphenolic concentrations (apical meristems). Urchins fed diets of drift kelp had strong growth rates, because although drift kelp was low in nutrients, the tissue also contained low polyphenolic concentrations.

As a foundation species, giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera sustains high growth rates and primary productivity under dense shading canopies through an efficient system of translocation that provides energy and nutrients to growing tissues. This study investigated what impact removing the growing point or apical meristem from M. pyrifera, as occurs in storms, commercial harvest and historically in grazing by the Stellar's sea cow, has on the physiology of the remaining immature sub-apical blades. Blades from fronds experienced increased growth and erosion rates within the first week after removal of the apical meristem as compared with controls. After two weeks growth and erosion rates were no longer significantly different between manipulated blades and control but substantial differences in concentrations of the sugar mannitol as well as nitrogen and carbon content persisted. The study revealed physiological effects of apical meristem loss that merit further investigation as to their causal mechanisms and suggest the potential for meristem removal to alter interactions with primary consumers",,hms_by836jp6882.tei.xml

Different amounts of these hard tissues are laid down depending upon climate-related or ecological factors. Chronologies produced from Pacific Ocean splitnose rockfish otoliths and Pacific Northwest noble fir and mountain hemlock tree-rings were studied in unison. By using multiple sites and species different aspects of a climate or ecology study can be compared and contrasted. Linkages between the terrestrial and marine climates can be better understood. Ultimately tree-ring chronologies could be used as a proxy for fish growth.

The fuel cells consist of graphite-based electrodes with the anodes planted in the anoxic environment of the sediment and the cathodes in oxic seawater. Such fuel cells have shown dependence on microbes that oxidize organic compounds using nitrate, manganese, iron, and sulfate as electron acceptors due to absence of O2 gas below the sediment surface. Sulfide, a by-product of such microbes and a limiting reactant (the other being organic carbon) in the seafloor fuel cell, readily oxidizes to elemental sulfur when in contact with the anode. In a biological analysis of the anodes, bacteria of the family Geobacteraceae, a known family for shuttling electrons from organic material to the electrode, appeared predominantly. In a current project in the laboratory, similar fuel cells have been designed, but rather than depending on sediment for fuel, decaying plankton (collected offshore of Newport, Oregon) will provide the organic carbon. While biological and other chemical factors are studied in conjunction to power generated by the plankton-based fuel cell, it is proposed that the sulfide concentrations in the anode chambers also be studied over time to note any dependence or independence of sulfide in the system by means of spectrophotometric detection of regularly collected water samples.",,

We study to verify seasonal timing of post larval Ghost shrimp Neollypaea (Callianassa) californiensus (N. californiensus) in the Yaquina Bay, Oregon; by means of a centrifugal pump system that collects samples in the vertical water column at the Hatfield Marine Science Centers (HMSC) pump house dock. In reviewing the early life history of N. californiensus, one stage indicated a seasonal difference in recruitment timing in late spring and early summer. In persistence of our post-larval study we conduct a quantitative analysis to see if there is a significant difference in numbers of post-larval present, vs. other life stages, if so, then we should find higher numbers of them in the tidal current. To date, little research has been devoted to obtaining daily migration patterns on post larval stages of Ghost shrimp. Field studies were conducted to measure the temporal pattern of N. californiensis larvae utilizing a centrifugal pump system. In the laboratory daily samples will be sorted to estimate the abundance, size, and stage of N. californiensis. We concurrently examine three components on this project 1) assess the timing and magnitude of larval pulses in Yaquina Bay, 2) quantify the temporal patterns in late-stage larvae (i.e. potential recruits), and 3) assess the centrifugal pump system catching larvae within a 30-day time series.

After necropsy and parasite analysis of stomachs and intestines, Lecithaster gibbosus, a marine nematode, had high prevalence, abundance, and intensity at all stations, especially 10 nautical miles off the Columbia River. Steelhead caught 22 nautical miles off of La Push, WA had a more diverse parasite community on average, had the greatest marine parasite abundance (excluding L. gibbosus), and ate larger prey suggesting an early outmigration. Fish caught 1O nautical miles off the Columbia River and 15 nautical miles off Cape Meares, OR contained more freshwater parasites, fewer marine parasites (excluding L. gibbosus), and had shorter fork lengths suggesting relatively later dates of ocean-entry.

This study examined the response of larval Pacific cod to changes in light intensity, food availability, and surface flow in a controlled laboratory setting. The response of cod to light was found to depend on food availability, with cod remaining at constant near-surface depth in the presence of food regardless oflight level, and decreasing depth with increasing light levels in the absence of food. Additionally, surface flow was found to decrease larval depth across all light ranges. Behavioral analyses showed cod increased activity with increasing light levels in the absence of food, and maintained relatively constant activity levels in the presence of food.

When a fisherman brings a rockfish to the surface, they often suffer from what is known as barotrauma or catastrophic decompression, which can include, but is not limited to embolism in bodily tissues, organ displacement, and ruptured swim bladders. Very little is known about the long-term effects of catastrophic decompression upon various species of rockfish. However, rockfish serve as staples to the recreational fishery along the Oregon coast, and management of these fish is difficult without knowing whether or not catch-and-release methods are effective at reducing mortality rates. This study compared external barotrauma indicators with internal symptoms. It found that for black rockfish, all symptoms worsen with increasing depths. Yelloweye rockfish generally were the most symptomatic fish. Quillback rockfish displayed external symptoms, but had no detrimental internal symptoms. Canary rockfish were extremely variable. Ultimately, it is difficult to judge internal symptoms based on external indicators and ecological and anatomical differences in species contribute to great variability among them.",,

Paleo climate reconstructions from tree rings have been a leading source of past climate data. However, trees whose rings record the marine climate signal are often located far from the ocean on montane sites, where the ocean climate must first be transferred to the atmosphere before reaching the trees, and can often get dispersed in the process. Therefore, a long-lived, increment-forming marine organism would provide a more faithful record of ocean variability. We have found that growth increments in geoducks (Panopea abrupta) provide an excellent record of multiple aspects of the ocean environment. Growth increment chronologies we developed from two sites in the northern Pacific near British Columbia record not only the broad-scale ocean patterns of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Northern Oscillation Index, but also capture fine-scale local sea surface temperature patterns, creating a detailed view of local ocean variability, spatial trends, and seasonality. This fine-scale view is not possible with tree-rings, due to climate signal dispersal. In an example reconstruction of local sea surface temperatures, we were able to explain 62% of the variance with our geoduck chronology, extending the climate record, which had previously ended in 1937, back to 1880. Geoducks are thus a very promising tool for paleoclimate reconstruction, offering the direct proximity to the ocean and the fine-scale resolution that is unavailable from tree-ring data.",,

This study used grain-size distribution and water velocity data compared with prior studies to conclude where change in the delta substrate has occurred and under what conditions deposition is likely to occur. Grab samples and video footage were used to map the substrate and a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler was used to measure water velocity and subsequently to estimate bed shear velocity. Currents west of the river were on average lower then on the east suggesting deposition is likely to occur on the west side. Deposition of fine sediment was found west of the river while the seabed east of the river has remained coarse. Deposition of sand is likely to occur during periods of low shear velocities during ebb and slack tides.

Species and communities within these habitats vary spatially and temporally; controlled by sediment composition, disturbance, primary production, and biotic interactions (Lenihan and Micheli, 2001). These variations can occur over a matter of meters and result in highly patchy sea floors (Snelgrove and Butman, 1994). A relationship between grain-size and faunal diversity was first identified by Peterson (1913) and further investigated by Johnson (1957) becoming a widely accepted supposition until the 90's (Snelgrove and Butman, 1994). Snelgrove and Butman’s (1994) review of animal-sediment relationships noted no consistent relationship in the literature between fauna and grain size and questioned if other mechanisms are driving the apparent relationship. Gray (2002) maintains the animal-sediment relationship and argues that many results cannot be considered characteristic of soft-sediment communities as a whole because most studies are small in spatial and temporal scale and lack extensive sampling. Regional scale diversity controls local species richness and environmental factors in turn determine regional richness. Environmental factors are grain-size diversity, temperature, and productivity. Gray (2002) further postulates that reduced richness may be the result of geologic history such as the Pleistocene glaciation of high latitudes. Benthic animals may not have had the time needed to fully colonize or establish stable communities in environs bound up or scraped clean by ice. Both reviews agree that further sampling controlling for a number of biologically relevant physical factors, including sediment grain size, need to be performed over larger temporal and spatial scales (Snelgrove and Butman, 1994; Lenihan and Micheli, 2001; Gray 2002).",,fhl_2011_Singer_25942.tei.xml

This study demonstrates a significant difference in the lethal temperature tolerance between two populations 30 kilometers apart on San Juan Island, WA.

Burrowing force in different sediments is measured using resin models of sand lance and a materials testing system. The final testing methods are validated by first varying the volume of sediment, mixing procedure, and speed. Laboratory limitations do not preclude comparison with in-vivo activity. There is a non-linear relationship between force and grain size. In general, coarser sediments are more difficult to penetrate. When the scales were removed, models more easily penetrated the sediment, but produced a similar non-linear trend.

Most current forecasting models lump all members of a species under one climatic envelope, thus ignoring the possibility of local adaptation among isolated populations of a wide-ranging species to result in differing climatic needs for each population compared to the species as a whole. To provide experimental evidence of the importance of local adaptation, we test each life stage of seven populations of copepod Tigriopus californicus ranging fifteen degrees in latitude, expecting populations and possibly life stages to differ in thermal tolerance. Our results show populations living in cooler climates generally have a lower thermal tolerance, and also juveniles exhibit higher thermal tolerances than adults, which could affect how a population responds to changing conditions.

Many studies have been conducted involving beating rate, that is, how often barnacles extend their cirri. However little research has been done on how flow rates can affect the actual feeding rates of barnacles, meaning the rate at which they obtain food using their cirri. We predicted that in faster moving water barnacles would be able to obtain more food particles due to the flux of food around them. We also predicted that in slower moving water barnacles feeding rate would be lower because settling rate would be higher. These predictions led to the hypothesis that there must be an optimal flow rate at which feeding rate is highest. Our results showed that settling rates of food particles were highest in slower moving water, however, we were unable to obtain enough data about how feeding rates would vary with changing flow rates.

Yet little is known about coastal acidification and very few studies have characterized the carbonate chemistry of coastal zones or intertidal rock pools where many calcifying organisms exist. In addition to various physical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (D.O.), and salinity), we characterized the carbonate chemistry by taking measurements of pH, total alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of two tide pools (0.41 m3 and 0.10 m3) located at Dead Man’s Cove on San Juan Island, Washington, to determine the extent of variation over the course of one tidal cycle and compared those results to local water samples taken from the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

On separate, consecutive days, the alga Ulva sp. and the mussle Mytilus trossulus were added to the smaller of the tide pools to observe the potential impact of photosynthetic versus respiring biomass on the carbonate chemistry. Adding algae resulted in an expected increase in pH, a decrease in DIC, and an increase in Ω Ca and Ω Ar. Total alkalinity decreased less than expected; perhaps due to the shading of coralline algae by Ulva which may have prevented coralline calcification. pCO2 decreased less than expected on day 2 relative to day 1 in the treatment pool and may have been due to changes in weather relative to the first day. Addition of mussels resulted in an expected increase in DIC, an increase in pCO2 and reductions in Ω Ca and Ω Ar. D.O. did not increase and pH did not decrease as much as expected on day 3 in the treatment pool and these unexpected findings may be due to the fact that mussels were not allowed to acclimate.

We examined the fluctuation in DIC, total alkalinity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity in two tide pools in Dead Man’s Cove, San Juan Island, WA over the course of the low tide. To better understand the relative contributions of photosynthesizers and respirers to changes in carbonate chemistry, we added Ulva to one pool on the second day, and Mytilus trossulus on the third day. During the low tide, tidepools saw a decrease in DIC and alkalinity, and an increase in pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. There is evidence of a small signal of decrease in DIC due to Ulva addition and increased DIC due to Mytilus addition.

I focused on these elements in this study by assessing haul-out tendencies of a local population of harbor seals on Yellow Island, Washington, and contrasting these characteristics between female-pup pairs and solitary seals. I found that seal abundance varied with temperature, tidal height, and time of day, although these factors were not independent and worked simultaneously to determine haul-out abundance. Female-pup pairs hauled out in proportion to the number of female-pup pairs at the study site, suggesting these pairs were not more likely to haul-out than solitary seals under any conditions. It is possible that due to the unique adaptations of harbor seals during the pupping season, including a maternal foraging cycle and comparatively precocial pups, females and their young did not have different haul-out needs than other seals. However, females with young remained in the study site for a longer period of time, even as haul-out sites decreased. This finding was consistent with other studies demonstrating the increased site fidelity and decreased length of foraging trips of females with pups during the pupping season.

Distance was also measured from the lookout point to each site and compared to the number of seals on each haul out site. As the tide height increased, the number of seals hauled out on sites A and F decreased dramatically, while those on B, D and E remained the relatively the same, which shows that those from A and F did not move to the closer haul out sites. The tide height and what time of day seemed to have an effect on the number of seals in the water and the proportion of how many were in the fast current compared to those in the slow current. Also, distance may be an important factor because more seals were hauled out on A and F, which are much further away from observers on land than other sites.

I studied the behavior of a Bald Eagle pair at Avenue Point, San Juan Island, Washington from 8-20 August 2011. Specifically, I recorded four behavior types (sitting, scanning, preening, and moving) at four-minute intervals during an observation period. I also noted eagle vocalizations and the relative distance between pair members along the shoreline. Behaviorally, eagles spent the majority of their time sitting (46%), followed by scanning (26%), preening (20%), and moving (7%). This might be justified energetically, due to the necessity during the post-breeding season of conserving energy for migration to wintering grounds. I saw only two predation attempts, both entailing fish prey and both unsuccessful, though other observers reported successful fish and gull predations during my study period. Vocalizations were separated into “chatters” and “peals”. Chatters were 8 times more likely to be used when two or more eagles were present, whereas “peals” were 5 times more likely to occur when either one or &gt; two eagles were present. This result suggests that chatter calls are used for communicating within a pair, while peals are used for territorial purposes. The pair of eagles I studied spent &gt;70% of their time between 5 m and 300 m apart from one other. This suggests that during the post-breeding stage they prefer to separate themselves spatially along their territory’s shoreline, as opposed to perching close together.

To explore the possibility of physiological adaptations to low oxygen availability, the length of rest periods following dives was measured to see if pelagic cormorants displayed dive time to rest time rations that deviated from the a 1:1 ratio typical of aerobic diving.

During the slack high tide numbers dropped to intermediate levels, and then declined during ebbing tides and remained very low until the next flooding tide. During flooding tides the birds aggregated in the north end of the pass where prey availability was highest.

To investigate this hypothesis, more research is needed on the other ascidian clade, Stolibranchia. In this study we strived to use maximum-likelihood analysis to compare the evolution of hh in Stolidobranchia and Phleobranchia ascidians. Future research will investigate the different developmental roles of hh in Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia ascidians.",,fhl_2011_Miller_26646.tei.xml

Notochord evolution can be studied with two tunicates—the tailed M. oculata and the tailless M. occulta. The tailed M. oculata has 40 notochord cells that are converged and extended. The tailless M. occulta does not form a tail in their larval stage as it only has 20 notochord cells that have not converged or extended. A hypothesis for the loss of notochord cells in M. occulta is that the notochord cells are being destroyed by apoptosis (programmed cell death). In this study, preparations for studying programmed cell death (PCD) using two genes Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) and Programmed cell death interacting protein 6 (PCDIP6) were made for in situ hybridizations. A cell death assay and in situ hybridizations will be done in the future on a variety of developmental stages of both the tailed and tailless species to assess differential regulation of the PCD genes.

Previous studies using fish as models have suggested that social behaviours such as schooling may covary with behavioural lateralization at the population-level. Here, we assess the strength, degree and repeatability of behavioural lateralization in schooling fish. Two of the species studied (Aulorhynchus flavidus and Gasterosteus aculeatus) were found to express population-level symmetry in the direction of lateralization whereas one species (Ammodytes hexapterus) showed no indication of population-level lateralization. We also provide evidence that behavioral lateralization is repeatable over time. From our cross-species comparisons we conclude that population-level lateralization is not necessarily related to a gregarious life-style. Further studies should test repeatability over longer periods of time and the role of lateralization in schooling behavior.",,fhl_2011_Lucas_26648.tei.xml

Traditional measures of swimming performance are estimated under laboratory conditions using steady water flow. However, these experiments potentially underestimate the actual cost of swimming under unsteady water flows that characterize natural systems. Using a swimming respirometer and video recordings, we swam Cymatogaster aggregata using a standard Ucrit swimming trial under one of three flow conditions with the same mean water velocity at each speed increment: steady flow (control), low amplitude water velocity fluctuations ( A=0.5BLs-1) and high amplitude water velocity fluctuations (A=1BLs-1). We found that unsteady flows increase the metabolic cost of swimming, but only when high flows push a swimming fish beyond the threshold for exclusively aerobic metabolism (beyond Uburst). Furthermore, unsteady flows at the highest amplitude treatment decreased the maximum mean velocity (Ucrit) and mean gait transition velocity (Upc) achieved by individuals compared to the control and low amplitude unsteady flows. However, lower costs of swimming than predicted in low amplitude flows below Uburst suggest that fish are able to take advantage of the cyclical wave patterns and economize energy expenditure. Mean pectoral fin beat frequency did not differ significantly among treatments.

Observations gathered by studies using accelerometers are largely limited to the identification of simple behaviours such as resting and swimming, yet fine-scale movements such as feeding and escape responses are mostly undetected. In this experiment, we aim to establish a link between acceleration traces and fast-start movements in the Great Sculpin (M. polyacanthocephalus) by the analysis of acceleration data from accelerometers and a high-speed video camera. Feeding events, escape events and spontaneous movements were triggered and observed using a 100Hz recording accelerometer (Little Leonardo Ltd, Japan) and a high-speed video camera for n = 7 great sculpin. Kinematic comparison between acceleration obtained from accelerometers and high-speed video camera were performed using vector transformation, yet prove to be difficult due to differences in reference frames and different sources of error. To establish a link between behaviour and acceleration, statistical analysis shows that the signature of spontaneous events can be described by the variation of the magnitude of acceleration which is significantly lower in spontaneous events compared to fast-start movements. Most of this information is lost (50%) if the accelerometer sampling rate is lower than 30Hz. Furthermore, two parameters (the value of Amax the variation of acceleration in lateral and forward direction) allow us to differentiate between escape events and feeding events. These results are a valuable contribution to understanding acceleration data in the field and the issues associated with low sampling rates.",,fhl_2011_Broell_26677.tei.xml

The degree of individual variation in both oxygen consumption rate (ṀO2) and kinematic performance was evaluated from this Ucrit challenge. Fast escape performance was also evaluated in the same group of fish. There was an approximately two-fold variation in metabolic rate of fish swimming at 0.5 body lengths per second (MR@0.5 bl s-1) and active metabolic rate, aerobic scope for swimming and critical swimming speed. A significant correlation was found between active metabolic rate and aerobic scope and between MR@0.5 bl s-1 and aerobic scope.

By utilizing expected patterns in salmon presence, this study sought to assess the capacity of harbor seal foraging to act as an accurate proxy for salmon presence and activity in Cattle Pass, Washington. Salmon were expected to be present in the channel beginning mid-summer, at which point it should be easier for individual fish to migrate northward through Cattle Pass during northward-flowing flooding tides.

This tail is believed to benefit progeny by facilitating motility, which in turn permits a wider variety of anchoring environments and a higher probability of finding favorable settling conditions (Huber et al ., 2000).

Intertidal bivalves rely on the successful settlement of larvae and the survival and growth of juveniles. Determining the distribution of juvenile bivalves is important for understanding the distribution and predicting the presence of adult bivalves, for both ecological and commercial reasons. Measuring growth rates and mortality of juvenile bivalves can shed light on what is necessary to carry a juvenile bivalve through adulthood. I surveyed several sites in the San Juan Islands, WA, recording sediment type, tidal height, beach slopes and wave exposures to determine the abundance of juveniles at these sites and what factors can be used as indicators of juvenile presence. I found that surface granules, surface mud, beach slope and subsurface shell hash were correlated with patterns observed in clam assemblages. It also appears that a particular site is a better predictor of clam assemblages and physical features than tidal height. I also tested the response of several species of intertidal clams—Tresus capax, Saxidomus giganteus, Macoma spp., Protothaca staminea, Venerupis philippinarium and Mya arenaria—to increased sediment temperatures during low-tide of different lengths. I found that growth increased in ideal conditions from species that live lowest in the intertidal to those that live in the high intertidal. Mortality in elevated temperatures increased with decreasing intertidal elevation.

One such species is the barnacle Balanus glandula, which exhibits plasticity in both its feeding behavior and the morphology of its feeding cirri. Barnacles feed actively at low flow speeds, but can feed passively at higher flow speeds. Additionally, individuals in habitually low flow environments have longer and thinner cirri than barnacles in high flow environments. This study explores how behavioral and morphological plasticity interact to give barnacles from low flow environments an advantage while feeding at slower water velocities. Using a flow tank to observe feeding behavior, barnacles were placed in flows ranging from 0 to 10 cm/sec. Barnacles from a low flow site employed passive feeding at lower water velocities than barnacles from a high flow site. Passive feeding, when possible, is thought to increase the energetic efficiency of feeding compared to active feeding. In slower water velocities, the increased ability to feed passively benefits low flow barnacles compared to high flow barnacles.",,fhl_2011_Cushman_26687.tei.xml

I based my hypothesis on several assumptions based on conclusions of a study from 1995 to 1997 by Zamon: water density fluctuations in San Juan Channel are evidence that tidal currents affect the source from which plankton is derived. Flooding tides mix colder, saltier water from Juan de Fuca into San Juan Channel. Tides create predictable patters of zooplankton availability for planktivorous animals (Zamon 2000).

A locus containing an unusual gene arrangement of the Bobcat gene within the first intron of the Manx gene has been shown to be essential for the development of chordate features in molgulid tadpole larvae. Sequencing and closer examination of ascidian genomes show that there is a unique gene arrangement of SSNA1 upstream and adjacent to Manx and Bobcat within the Molgulidae which is not found in cionid ascidians; however, a similar arrangement of SSNA1 directly upstream of Bobcat was found in Oikopleura dioica supporting Appendicularia as a sister group to the Molgulidae. SSNA1 is expressed in tailed Molgula oculata gonads and not in tailless M. occulta gonads, suggesting SSNA1 could have a role in the development of tailed larvae. Expression of these key genes could be affected by one another’s close proximity, disturbing normal gene expression and thereby larval development of chordate features.

Kelps also make up a high amount of biomass and provide structure and habitat to many organisms. However, little kelp biomass is directly consumed. However, its biomass is transported via a spatial subsidy. This spatial subsidy links near-shore primary production with comparatively deep water primary consumers. One such consumer is the red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. Urchins are known to feed on kelps transported by the spatial subsidy. These drift kelps may spend weeks drifting and degrading before they are encountered by an urchin. There has been little research on how the degradation or aging of kelps has on palatability to urchins. This study tests the feeding preference of red urchins to three species of kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana, Agarum fimbriatum, Saccharina subsimplex) that were both fresh and aged with the hope of gaining insight to how kelps move through the spatial subsidy. We also investigated how phlorotannin content changes as kelp age. Some research suggests that phlorotannins act as herbivory deterrent and that as kelp age they lose their phlorotannins. We found that Nereocystis luetkeana was the most preferred kelp species and that fresh kelps were preferred over aged ones. Analysis of phlorotannin content showed that there is a difference between species in phlorotannin content but the data suggests that there is little to no change through time.

Prior to direct observations, I modeled a suite of larval shapes, blastocoel volumes, and densities, predicting the effects of these features on larval swimming. Results of the models indicated that water density affected swimming, and that altering blastocoel density compensated for these effects. Using this information, I was able to narrow down physically feasible blastocoel volumes and fluid densities, which helped shape my hypotheses. My hypotheses were further shaped by the natural history of D. excentricus larvae: In the earliest stages of the larva, the blastocoel is anteriorly located. This means that the fluid within the blastocoel should be less dense than the larval body in order to ensure correct orientation. Based on the models, I hypothesized that there would exist a direct correlation between the rearing salinity and the larvae’s internal density.

Species interactions’ are fundamental drivers of ecosystem and community dynamics. Comprehensive climate change assessments demand consideration of both the role of species’ interactions in communities, and modulation of body temperature and thus thermal stress impacts via organism morphology and mobility. Sharp environmental stress gradients and a gradient of emersion time make the rocky intertidal a model system for studying the effects of climate change on communities. In this study we manipulated low-tide aerial temperature to test the predicted effects of climate change on the interactions between a motile predator, the gastropod Nucella ostrina, and its sessile prey, the barnacle Balanus glandula. Nucella ostrina, exhibits periodicity in foraging on Balanus glandula, with maximum foraging occurring during periods of nighttime exposure. Subjecting Nucella to chronic and acute aerial temperature manipulations did not alter the timing or magnitude of a previously documented foraging bout, though asynchrony in the feeding of males and females was observed. Movement of Nucella away from food during low tide exceeded initiation of feeding independent of aerial temperature, suggesting behavioral refuge.

Our goal was to identify an optimal prey orientation and tooth shape combination that requires the least amount of force to crack hard-shelled prey. Amount of force represents the energy a durophagous predator expends to crack its prey. We modeled the crushing interaction between two sets of tooth models and two Nucella sp. snail shell orientations. Tooth models were grouped into a set that ranges from a convex to concave occlusal surface, and set that has a central cusp with a variable radius. Snail shell orientations included an upside down position, such that the aperture was facing up; and a right-side-up position, such that the aperature was facing down. We found that it took the least total force to crush the shell in its upside down position. At this point of the shell, tight whorls have not formed to strengthen the shell as they have on the upper surface, closer to the shell’s apex, where the aperature is facing down. We also found that as convexity of the tooth increased, the force needed to crack the shell decreased. Finally, we found that as the cusp radius decreased, or as the tooth becomes sharper, the force needed to break the prey item decreased. These results reveal that form and function of tooth shape determine how predators expend energy for prey handling, which affects how predator-prey relationships evolve through space and time. Some durophagous predators may have evolved sharper, more convex tooth morphology to crush hard-shelled prey in preferred orientations.",,fhl_2012_Grewal_26994.tei.xml

Pictures of crab carapace and the right claw were imported to Image J to measure aspect ratio, radius of curvature, propus length, and denticle position for each denticle as well as the carapace length. Generalist species such as Oregonia gracilis tend to have a smaller radius of curvature and a larger aspect ratio. The specialists’ species such as Pugettia richii, Pugettia gracilis, Pugettia producta, Metacarcinus magister, Cancer productus, Cancer oregonensis, Telmessus cheiragonus, Scyra acutifrons, and Hemigrapsus nudus have a larger radius of curvature and a smaller aspect ratio. Generalist species commonly eat small soft marine organisms and macro algae, while the specialist species consume hard-shelled prey, such as barnacles, clams, snails, etc. Most specialist species have wider, blunter denticles at the fulcrum and become narrower, sharper towards the tip. The mechanical advantages for these crab species comes from the tip of the claw; allowing them to crush their prey. Generalist species have sharper, narrower teeth from the fulcrum to the tip of the claw. These crabs do not use their claws for crushing, but more for shredding. Denticle position and mechanical advantages heavily impact the dietary and foraging behaviors of the crabs studied.

Sea urchin feces may provide an important link from the relatively shallow benthic areas to other benthic communities, such as those in the deep-sea, as urchin “mobs” are capable of mowing down entire forests of algae and, of that algae, their digestive systems absorb on average only 60% of the calories available. Through these relatively unprocessed feces, a large amount of material could be available to benthic communities, making the feces a potentially vitally important nutrient conveyer to benthic organisms. To gain insight into the composition of urchin feces, and more insight into their digestive system, I conducted a series of tests on the caloric content of algae and urchin feces. First, I tested two species of algae at various stages of decay for caloric content. Then, I tested aged and fresh feces of 12 urchins on diets of either Nereocystis luetkeana (Nereocystis), or Agarum fimbriatum, for caloric content using a modified version of a micro assay technique. I found that aging dramatically increases the caloric values of both Nereocystis feces and tissue samples, however in agarum feces and tissue samples aging has little effect. This could have significant implications in considering where benthic organisms acquire their nutrients, as well as the importance of sea urchins in providing a link to those organisms.",,fhl_2012_Kimber_26997.tei.xml

Water from the Juan de Fuca Strait enters the pass from the South during flooding tides, while water from the Strait of Georgia enters from the North during ebbing tides. The questions I am interested in answering are: how does the marine influence of the Juan de Fuca Strait and the estuarine influence of the Strait of Georgia affect the abundance of zooplankton in Cattle Pass? Do tidal processes affect the abundances of zooplankton in Cattle Pass? Is zooplankton abundance correlated with upper trophic level foraging? I based my hypothesis on several assumptions based on conclusions of a study from 1995 to 1997 by Zamon: water density fluctuations in San Juan Channel are evidence that tidal currents affect the source from which plankton is derived. Flooding tides mix colder, saltier water from Juan de Fuca into San Juan Channel. Tides create predictable patterns of zooplankton availability for planktivorous animals (Zamon 2000). I hypothesized that ebbing tides advect zooplankton from the Strait of Georgia while flooding tides advect zooplankton from the Juan de Fuca Strait. Zooplankton will be more numerous in the more oceanic waters during flood tide.

It is therefore important to understand trophic relationships between marine organisms in order to prevent the drastic change of ecosystem structures due to anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing. In the Salish Sea, rockfish, Sebastes caurinus and Sebastes maliger, are an important predatory fish that have been in decline in past years. In order to understand the predator-prey interactions of rockfish in the San Juan Islands, we used prey tethering techniques, to assess relative rates of predation on shrimp and how much predation is occurring from rockfish. Coon-stripe shrimp, Pandalus danae, were tethered and attached to a frame that was deployed at two sites with different rockfish abundance. A camera was also deployed in order to record video footage of predation. Our method of tethering was successful, showing 100% predation in deployments longer than 18 hours and capturing video footage during the day without the use of an artificial light. Various predators were observed in video data from each site.

While many studies have examined how multiple abiotic variables affect mussel attachment strength, few have performed extensive single variable tests within a controlled lab setting. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature on byssus production in the native Northern Pacific intertidal blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, and expected to see a decline in production with increasing temperatures (specifically, between 18°C-25°C). We also hypothesized that threads produced in warmer temperatures would show a visual decline in quality, either through thinning, degradation, or tearing. Mussels were placed in a temperature controlled flume for 24 hours. Six different trials were run at 10°C, 14°C, 18°C, 20°C, 22°C, and 25°C. Byssal threads were counted for the duration of each trial to determine production and rate of attachment. Threads produced under these different temperature regimes were analyzed under an SEM to visually compare differences in quality. Overall, there was a significantly negative correlation between thread production and increases in temperature, with the highest amount occurring at 18°C (11.25 threads +2.0 s.e.m.) and the lowest at 25°C (0 threads). Acclimatization and rate of thread production was also negatively affected by temperature increases. In addition, we saw a significant difference in percentage of mussel attachment between temperatures, with up to 93% attached in the 10°C and 18°C treatments and 50-0% in the 20°C-25°C treatments. However, visual analyses of thread quality differences were inconclusive.

The gross morphology of the chelae and denticles, the tooth-like structures along the pincher fingers, may provide information about prey selection and foraging behavior. We measured the aspect ratio (height/width) and radius of curvature (radius of the tooth tip) of the denticles on the chelae of Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. Our specimens were collected from Friday Harbor in the San Juan Islands, Washington and varied in size from 6-21 cm carapace length. We examined denticle morphological changes in an ontogenetic series as well as along the length of the immobile finger, propus. We found that as M. magister matures, their denticles became overall taller and pointier as represented by higher aspect ratio morphology. Variation in denticle morphology in the ontogenetic series appears to be directly related to shifts in diet with age. Along the propus length, denticles were broad and molariform in the center and more pointed nearest the fulcrum and tip. The layout of various shaped denticles along the propus indicates that both crushing as well as peeling or piercing feeding techniques are used by M. magister.

The fish observed at the wave field were larger and heavier than those at Jackson Beach, both across the season and on a discrete, week- by-week scale. There was a slight disparity in hibernation periods between depth populations. In the wave field, most of the fish at that site began hibernating during the second half of October as interpreted from the stomach fullness of fish.

Calanoid copepod density also peaked on the 10th (5,159.31 individuals m-3) then decreased with slight fluctuations. Nauplii decreased in abundance during the season, especially relative to adult calanoids, probably due to their life history pattern which favors development to copepodite stage V before over-wintering diapause. Lipid reserves in calanoid copepods increased immediately following the diatom bloom, then remained low the rest of the season. The greatest percent of sand lance with calanoids in their stomachs (23.1%) was found before the plankton blooms. It is suggested that this may be because they begin hibernation without regard to a fall bloom, since fall bloom timing is very inconsistent. Overall, a temporal linkage in trophic dynamics was evident between primary and secondary productivity, but not between the plankton and sand lance.

The demosponges Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae are commonly found in the San Juan Islands, and were used in a comparison study of sponge morphology and filter feeding rates. Sponge samples were collected from two sites, one intertidal and one subtidal, and were treated with a microalgae monoculture of Nannochloropsis. Water samples were taken at regular intervals and measured by spectrophotometer at λ 440nm for absorbance. Post ANOVA statistical analysis samples from the intertidal site were found to not show any variance within species at any collection point. Specimens from the subtidal site failed to produce conclusive data possibly due to contamination of sponges by other organisms inhabiting the sponges or weakness in the methodology. Therefore, the results of this study conclude that the three species Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae may not have significantly different filter feeding efficiencies even though each species exhibit different morphotypes.",,fhl_2012_Blair_27021.tei.xml

This study had two distinct purposes; to survey fluorescence in a marine fouling community and to describe inducible fluorescence in two Polychaete species. In the first part of the study, organisms were collected, the fluorescence was photographed, the morphological feature(s) that fluoresced was identified and the wavelength was characterized when possible. The functional morphology of the fluorescent structures was then considered to determine if the fluorescence might have a behavioral purpose, although no clear correlations were found. Eight species in four phyla fluoresced in green, orange and red wavelengths. The second part of the study identified the anatomical source of inducible fluorescence and the stimulus which caused its release in two Polychaete worms, Abarenicola pacifica and Dodecaceria concharum. The fluorescence in A. pacifica was found to be mucus secreted from a pore dorsal to the parapodia during dissection and tactile stimulation. In both A. pacifica and D. concharum, the density of the fluorescence coupled with its secretion without puncture of coelomic cavities or blood vessels suggested it was mucus, although due to optical constraints the anatomical origin in D. concharum could not be determined. Chemosensory cues did not induce either species to release fluorescent material, but tactile stimuli did, including human fingers, shells and predators, suggesting a potential defense mechanism.",,fhl_2012_Dougherty_27022.tei.xml

In this study, I measured the force required to fracture the protective valves of two chiton species (Mopalia muscosa and Mopalia lignosa) after ten days of exposure to control conditions and conditions of raised pCO2. I measured this effect both on valves from freshly sacrificed animals, and on valves that had been dissected prior to treatment. My results show that dissolution of previously dissected valves effects valve strength in M. muscosa, but not in M. lignosa. Both species may compensate for the effects of dissolution in lowered pH treatments by actively depositing more shell material. M. musocsa valves are also, over all treatments, stronger than M. lignosa valves. The variation in baseline strength, and in response to ocean acidification, has implications for the future chiton community in the Northeast Pacific. Additionally, my results call for further research on the physiological tradeoffs of increased shell deposition and the ecological impacts of differential responses to ocean acidification.",,fhl_2012_Green_27023.tei.xml

Variation of form and nicheoccupation in arthropods relies on specialized appendages and regionalization of a common bauplan. The specialization of particular body regions leads to displays of sexual dimorphism. Cases of intraspecies morphotypes and sexual dimorphic characters reflect larger trends of morphological variation in all major arthropod clades. Here, I report a morphospace of sexually dimorphic brachyuran crustaceans from the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest and discuss inter- and intraspecies variation as it pertains to marine arthropods as whole. Abdominal shape changes in sexes of Cancer and Hemigrapsus were evaluated using geometric morphometrics and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Traditional morphometrics, measuring the dimensions of the carapace were also incorporated. The abdominal and body shape disparity between genders of both genera is found to be statistically significant through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical comparison test. Sexual dimorphism is not conserved in interspecies or in intraspecies relationships. Hemigrapsus specimens exhibit a higher degree of sexual dimorphism than Cancer specimens.

Among the polyplacophorans, it appears that the specific chiton species, Mopalia muscosa (Polyplacophora) also contain magnetite in the lateral teeth of their radula. The purpose of this study is to examine as to whether if magnetite bearing chitons exhibit magnetotactic behavior. This study was conducted in two parts: an artificial ambient magnetic field was manipulated in a laboratory to test for any magnetotactic behavioral responses. Through field observations, we observed the head orientation of chiton (vertical pitch and positional degree) which was documented in their natural habitat. Our artificial ambient magnetic field results indicate differences in head orientation between control group and experimental group and were statistically significant with a p-value &lt;0.02.

However, little work is available on the effect of high temperature stresses on rate of radula development. This study is a first-order attempt in examining the relationship of radula production and temperature between two gastropod species with very different uses for their radula—a predator, Nucella lamellosa, and a grazer, Lottia pelta—under elevated temperature conditions. Row density of new radula growth, and relative tooth wear along the anterior end of the radula, were compared between species and across 3 temperature settings. A negative correlation between water temperature and row density was observed for both study species. Furthermore, elevated temperature was negatively correlated with both feeding rates and tooth wear in N. lamellosa. This study suggests that stress from elevated temperatures is detrimental to radula development between species, and that temperature stress leads to a reduction in feeding, and thus, reduced usage of the radula.",,fhl_2012_Tierney_27026.tei.xml

In addition, the animals change their orientation position with water flow in order to maximize their food intake and growth. Both Chlamys rubida and Chlamys hastata exhibit these abilities, despite their morphological and behavioral differences. However, because of their profound distinctions that separate them between species, we suspect that the two groups will exhibit differences in their orientation preference to the current. Orientation position will optimize growth and feeding for these species within their local environment. Our hypothesis on scallops’ orientation was tested in a flume tank. Their angle in respect to the water flow were measured and recorded for comparison. The experiment demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in orientation preference between the two species in a well-lit environment, and that their vision had no considerable influence on their orientation.

Many medusoid hydrozoans are predators of epipelagic crustaceans and ecological competitors of fish for epipelagic prey. A change in this predator-prey dynamic may affect the entire epipelagic ecosystem. Ocean acidification exerts a physiological stress on planktonic crustaceans, which possess calcareous exoskeleton. It is therefore hypothesized that ocean acidification increases the feeding rate of medusoid hydrozoan on crustacean prey. This project aims to investigate the relationship between feeding rates of hydromedusa Aequorea Victoria on crustacean prey Artemia sp., under variable seawater CO2 concentrations: 450ppm CO2 and 950ppm CO2 . Each individual of A. Victoria was given 50 individual Artemia sp. and let feed for 1h under ambient temperature. Clearance rate was then calculated from the raw count of prey remaining after 1h. There is no statistically significant difference between the clearance rates of A. Victoria among the two treatment conditions and ambient seawater (n=5~9, p&gt;0.05).

They differ in that they do not have venomous stinging nematocysts but instead have numerous sticky colloblasts lining the tentacles. They also differ in locomotion, cnidarians typically use a contracting pulse of the bell to propel themselves, whereas, ctenophores use 8 rows of ctene plates that paddle the animal through the water. It is believed that they have true striated muscle and a primitive central nervous system (CNS) consisting of the aboral organ and polar fields. The Aboral organ is composed of a balancing statocyst that is attached to all ctene rows by a series of balancers and ciliated furrows. Signaling occurs from the aboral organ to the ctene rows. Each row is capable of beating separately from any of the others, indicating a complex signaling. Extending from this CNS are two nerve nets.

Samples of benthic organisms and sediment were collected from the delta floor, inventoried and analyzed, and the results mapped to find correlations between the two. The results showed patterns suggesting a correlation between grain size and diversity, with the greatest diversity at sites with high percentages of gravel, and the lowest diversity at sites with high percentages of mud. These findings demonstrate the importance of sediment size and sorting on the diversity of the Elwha delta.

Grain-size distributions of sediments from the river, the bluff, and the delta were also examined to determine sources of sediments from the delta. The sand-dominant region found at the west side of the river mouth and some local landward coarsening patterns suggested that grain-size distribution was under influences of waves. Though no strong correlation was found between tidal bed shear stress and grain-size distribution, other evidence was provided that suggest the impacts of tidal-induced currents on grain-size distribution. We found the poorly sorted region at the western offshore of the river mouth and the coarse-grains dominant regions near the river mouth; it is possibly due to focused and strong currents that causes high bed shear stress in those regions. Moreover, tidal-induced currents have a net northeastward flow which brings fine sediments toward the east. Therefore, we observed a region of fine sediments at the east of the river mouth.

The growth of these organisms is affected by riverine-oceanic interactions. A measurable interaction over 24 hours is the density difference between these water sources, where less-dense riverine water is warmer and has lower salinity. Ebb currents enhance the advection of riverine output, placing it on top of the oceanic water and creating stratification. Primary production increased during stratification periods, but reduced when transitioning between a flood and ebb current. Visual analysis of phytoplankton community composition also highlighted increases in the population during high ebb and flood current rates. The large increase in Skeletonema population during this study suggested that the movement or growth of certain phytoplankton genera are affected by these water source interactions.

Phenotypic traits such as gonad index and jaw diameter can be indicators of diet consistency and nutrient uptake and thus can be used to assess the possible role of exported kelp. In this study, individuals of an herbivorous (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) and a filter feeding (Balanus nubilus) species were sampled from near the kelp beds in the shallow subtidal photic environment (SSPE) and far from the kelp beds in the deep subtidal environment (DSE). Urchins in the DSE had significantly larger gonads and jaws in comparison to individuals in the SSPE. I conclude that urchins in the DSE were getting better fed, whether through quantity or quality of food, suggesting that drift algae was being exported from nearby kelp beds. There was no significant difference between barnacle gonad indices with depth suggesting that their particulate organic matter food was equal at both depths.

907,University of Washington,Friday Harbor Laboratories,27051,"Wang, Anne",Bacteria Abundance in Response to Increasingly Acidic Conditions,2012.0,"Global warming is a worldwide phenomenon that is the result of anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Although the increase in carbon dioxide levels now is 100 times faster than at the end of the last ice age (IPCC 2001, 2007), the ocean is the most important sink of carbon dioxide and have absorbed approximately half of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (Sabine et al. 2004). Many consequences are expected of global warming are occurring presently, one of which is ocean acidification. The average ocean surface water pH has decreased from 8.21 to 8.10 recently (Royal Society 2005). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts CO2 concentrations to reach 800ppmv by the end of the century which is equivalent to a decrease of 0.3-0.4 pH units (Orr et al. 2005). An effect of acidifying seawater is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, a drastic change in environmental condition for shell-forming marine organisms (Doney et al. 2009). The organisms affected directly ranges from plankton to corals, molluscs, and sea urchins (Doney et al. 2009). For example, reduced shell and soft body growth have been reported in mussels (Gazeau et al. 2007) and metabolic depression has been seen in European eels (Anguila anguila) at CO2 levels above 2% (Cruz-Neto and Steffensen 1997). Bacteria are hugely important to all ecosystems, including marine habitats. Marine bacteria are uniquely adapted to saline environments and they need salt for growth (Fenical 1993). Most marine bacteria are unicellular (Fenical 1993) and some such as Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are abundant oceanic primary producers (Azam and Worden 2004). Although the distribution of marine bacteria is poorly studied, 90% of marine bacterial flora is of the gram-negative genus Vibrio (Fenical 1993). Wang 3 Sediments, animate and inanimate surfaces, and internal spaces of living organisms are important microhabitats of marine bacteria (Fenical 1993). Internal spaces of marine organisms are often more nutrient rich than seawater (Fenical 1993). In particular, sponges and bacteria can form symbioses (Lee et al. 2009). Sponges can acquire their bacterial partners by filter feeding and selectively retaining bacteria (Taylor et al. 2007). The relationship is often mutualistic; bacteria benefit nutritionally while bacteria help sponges eliminate waste more efficiently (Beer and Ilan 1998), stabilize the skeleton (Rutzler 1985), or defend against pathogens and predators (Bewley et al. 1996). Bacteria are observed on the surface of Oriental shrimp (Palaeomon macrodactylus) eggs, American lobster (Homarus americanus) eggs, coral reefs, sea jellies, and other bacteria such as cyanobacterium Microcoleus lyngbyaceus (Fenical 1993). Bacteria are notably associated with chitinous plankton (Vezzulli et al. 2012). They are also a major food source for invertebrates, which reflects the energy available for higher trophic levels (Hall and Meyer 1998). Hall and Meyer (1998) found that invertebrates could derive &lt;10% to 100% of their carbon requirements from bacteria. Marine microorganisms such as bacteria have the potential for rapid growth. Thus, marine microorganisms are critical to global nutrient cycles (Arrigo 2005). Nitrogen, an essential nutrient, is used by organisms to form proteins, chlorophyll, and nucleic acids (Murray et al. 2005). In the ocean, it is present as a dissolved gas or as dissolved inorganic ions: nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium (Murray et al. 2005). Once thought to be restricted to very specific habitats and microbes, now we know that many bacteria are known for their nitrification and denitrification services to the ecosystem (Zehr and Ward 2002). Nitrification is a process of oxidation from ammonia to nitrate with nitrite as an intermediate species (Figure 3). Denitrification is the reverse reaction where nitrate is reduced to nitrite and is converted to nitrogen gas (Figure 3). Bacteria mediate these two processes which makes nutrients available to many organisms, including phytoplankton. Biodiversity of plant and animal communities are dependent on the availability of these nutrients (Bienhold et al. 2012). The objective of this mesocosm experiment is to determine differences in bacteria abundance in normal (600μatm), medium (1000μatm), and high (1300μatm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms serve as an intermediate for lab and field studies; mesocosms provide insight about changes to food webs, communities, and ecosystems.",,fhl_2012_Wang_27051.tei.xml

However these results are preliminary and only analyze one factor of change: temperature. There are other abiotic stressors changing due to climate change which could have other effects on Nereocystis luetkeana ecophysiology.

Stock cultures from the Botany Department at the University of Washington, Seattle and wild samples collected from the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories in Friday Harbor, Washington were examined. Wild samples were collected from coordinates at N 48° 32.723’ W 123° 00.729’.

The low light stock (8 μmol/m2/s) cultures had significantly higher growth rates than both the low light wild and ambient light (25 μmol/m2/s) stock.

Both sham wounding and wounding led to ROS production that varied with light level, although the relationship between the magnitude of the oxidative burst and irradiance was not linear.

One generates different coccolith profiles by varying how the same amount of mass is distributed among three stacked cylinders, representative of a coccolith. Another examines the sinking velocity of the coccolithophore as a function of the height of the stalk. Stalk height has a significant effect on the sinking velocity, as it can extend the radius of the coccolithophore and increase drag. The third model, looks at how transmission of light through a coccolith affects the irradiance at the cell surface. The thickness of the top element of the coccolith has a small effect on the transmission of light to the cell surface. Calcite is pretty translucent, especially when considering the thickness of the structure is ~50 nanometers thick. These models are then cross tested to see what is the effect of upper coccolith element thickness on sinking rate and what is the effect of stalk height on transmission.

This study uses plaster dissolution models and flow analysis to examine the effects of verrucose, pocked, and furrowed surface morphologies on potential mass transfer across plate corals. It also examines how flow interacts with these surfaces across platelike and cylindrical objects. Generally, dissolution per unit profile area increased with added ornamentation and surface area. However, there were diminishing returns with regards to material investment; the more surface area there was for dissolution, the less efficient dissolution was per unit surface area. Secondly, surface texture dictated flow of water, either directing flow to or away from the colony, or quelling movement completely. Surface texture also directs flow differently depending on gross morphology. Understanding flow at small scales, particularly around locations of polyps, is important for understanding mass transfer. This study is a first order attempt to address this issue, but further work is needed to quantify flow at the locations of polyps and the role of particular surface textures in engineering local flow regimes.",,fhl_2012_Tierney_27060.tei.xml

In the marine realm, ancient trilobites exhibit extreme exoskeleton disparity. It is commonly accepted that much of the variety of trilobite evolution, particularly in the head, reflects adaptation to assorted environments. Here, I demonstrate the relationship between cephalon morphology and fluid flow through turbulence and drag force. I examine the effect of genal spine length on (1) degree and position of turbulence relative to the trilobite body along with (2) amount of drag felt on the organism. General morphology of Devonian Eldredgeops (Trilobita: Phacopida) was used as a template. I do not suggest that Eldredgeops may have possessed cephalic spines, but rather, models were constructed with varying lengths of genal spines as a proof of concept. Trilobite models were constructed with five different genal spine lengths, from absent genal spines to spines extending past the rear of the body. In a flow tank, the forms were analyzed with dye stream tests to identify minimum turbulence and with a force transducer to measure drag forces. Laser techniques were used to visualize flow.

We divided tidal current into five different categories, and conducted 36 transects, recording the number of birds observed during each tidal current category. Our results suggest that the presence of birds in San Juan Channel correlates with changes in tidal current speed and direction. We observed a greater number of birds during periods of fast current, and fewer birds during slack and slow ebbs.

Pisaster ochraceus, a keystone predator of the intertidal zone will be especially affected by these fluctuations since they lack the ability to ion- or osmo-regulate. We examined the impact of prior exposure to low salinity and the presence of a food patch on the behavior of P. ochraceus larvae in a halocline. In the gastrula stage, P. ochraceus larvae were split into a low salinity treatment (reared in 20-22‰ filtered sea water) and a control treatment (reared in 30- 32‰ filtered sea water). In the first experiment, bipinnariae were introduced into the top or bottom of 20/30 haloclines. In the second experiment brachiolariae were introduced into control columns with and without the algae Isochrysis galbana, and into 20/30 haloclines with and without I. galbana patches at the halocline. The halocline posed a major barrier to larval vertical migration, especially for the younger bipinnaria stage. Low salinity larvae changed their distribution in the water column at a much slower rate than control larvae, indicating that they may have impaired swimming abilities. Brachiolariae from the controls aggregated in the halocline when a food patch was present but those from low salinity swam right through the food patch to the top of the column. Lowered salinity in the Salish Sea could result in larvae arriving in unsuitable habitats since their different vertical distribution in the water column may result in currents carrying them to unsuitable habitats.

Protozoic amoebae are the culprits of this invasion and while their feeding preferences or abilities are well known in regards to bacteria, with algae they are not. To begin implying an index of susceptibility between amoebic strains and marine algae, isolated Neoparamoeba sp., Paramoeba sp., and Thecamoeba sp. specimens from Hawai’i were given treatments of marine algae (Chaetoceros sp., Pleurochrysis carterae, Nanochloropsis sp., Skeletonema marinoi, Isochrysis sp.) in f/2- (silicon absent) media and algal density correlated to spectrophotometer absorbance values. Also, bacterial treatments were smeared in a uni-directional “raceway” on f/2- agar and the distance that amoebae from one end of the strip recorded as average migration rate per day. These methods proved successful in illustrating that the feeding abilities or preferences of marine amoebae vary greatly across algal and bacterial species.

Two species of Abarenicola who inhabit distinct areas of False Bay were examined. It was hypothesized that a sediment’s stiffness would be related to its grain-size composition and to animal distributions, and that worms would burrow more successfully in their own sediment. In sites with either A. pacifica or A. claparedi, grain size distribution was analyzed and a modified penetration test was used to quantify the stiffness of sediments. Additionally, each species was timed burrowing in the field in either its own sediment or the sediment of the other species. A. pacifica lived in stiffer, poorly-sorted sediment with a high proportion of silts and clays, while A. claparedi were found in less stiff, well-sorted sediments consisting mostly of fine sands. Despite living in distinct sediment types, worms did not burrow more quickly in their own sediment. However, burrowing angle and speed changes throughout burrowing suggest A. claparedi struggled to burrow successfully in the stiffer sediment of A. pacifica. Our results suggest that the material properties of sediment do vary with the grain size composition and that these material properties may play an important role in determining animal success in an area.

Patch width for Rhodomonas sp. remained near one cm for six hours while patch width for I. galbana increased to two cm in six hrs. For both algal species, cell concentration at the halocline declined significantly in the presence of Pisaster larvae. A greater decrease in cell concentration was observed for I. galbana when the food was at the bottom of the column rather than at the halocline. This was observed in the presence and absence of larvae. This indicates that for I. galbana, the decline in algal cell concentration at the bottom of the column might be due to cell movement towards the halocline. Interestingly, larvae remained around the halocline in the presence or absence of food for 6 hours. Living in stratified layers where thin phytoplankton layers might exist can be advantageous for P. ochraceus larvae by providing them with resources to feed, grow, and metamorphose but might also expose them to predation by higher trophic levels.",,fhl_2012_Driver_27069.tei.xml

One species, Phoronis pallida, is an inquiline commensal that aggregates in burrows made by the mud shrimp Upogebia pugettensis. Similar to other species of phoronids, there are questions surrounding the biogeography and reproductive habits of Phoronis pallida. The purpose of this study is to examine the P. pallida population level structure in Puget Sound, Washington, USA, and also infer from these data if the adults of this species are capable of reproducing asexually. Adult P. pallida specimens were collected from the shrimp burrows in the low intertidal mud flats of False Bay, Argyle Lagoon, and Padilla Bay in Washington’s Puget Sound region. Twenty-seven samples of this phoronid were collected from 16 burrows among all sites and successfully analyzed using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit one gene (COI). Statistical parsimony identified 24 distinct haplotypes sorted into two networks. The networks showed no geographic pattern among our sites but were separated by a large p-distance of 0.06 indicating either a sequence divergence. No evidence for asexual reproduction was found since only genetically distinct individuals were found from the same burrows. Further sampling at larger spatial scales is necessary to find the total number of haplotypes, determine if the networks correlate to larger geographic areas, and investigate the sequence divergence in P. pallida.",,fhl_2012_Fuller_27070.tei.xml

To lay groundwork for future study of this personality-CORT association, the stress responses of wild-caught rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) were characterized by determining the corticosterone (CORT) concentration in cloacal fluid (CF) collected noninvasively over 60 min of restraint. On the basis of previous studies of sparrows and tits, we hypothesized that social dominance would be inversely correlated both with baseline CF CORT concentration and with the response of CF CORT to restraint. After capture, restrained birds were held in the hand and fed for 45 min, during which a separate CF sample was collected over each of three 15-min periods. For the final 15 min, birds were moved to a flight cage and a fourth CF sample was collected without handling the bird; all samples were analyzed by direct RIA. In contrast to our predictions, baseline CF CORT (first 15-min sample) of all three age-sex classes did not differ. Although the predicted relation between previously published dominance status in this species (adult females &gt; first-year males &gt; first-year females) and CORT levels was not supported, young males tended to develop higher CF CORT concentration in response to restraint than did females of any age. Of six behaviors measured in the flight cage, one was inversely correlated with CF CORT concentrations in response to restraint: birds with higher CF CORT were significantly more restricted spatially in their exploration of the flight cage. Additionally, adult and hatch-year females tended to perch more on the front and side of the cage than hatch-year males did. In contrast to a previous study of restraint stress in captive rufous hummingbirds, the wild-caught birds in our study showed significantly increased CF CORT within 30 min of capture and no significant change thereafter, suggesting that the stress response can be quantified in the field in a shorter period of time with this noninvasive method than was previously thought.",,fhl_2012_Goloff_27071.tei.xml

Also, studying the fine scale distributions of microorganisms in these patches has traditionally involved very expensive, resource intensive methods. This has greatly hindered the ability to conduct research in this area. This paper present an alternative, high tech, low cost method that can be used to study these patch dynamics across a range of scales, from that of 10’s of centimeters to that of kilometers. This method involves the use of a waterproof enclosure that houses a microcomputer and imaging capture device that, with accompanying software, can analyze large batches of video for the presence, or lack thereof, of organisms of a desired size class. This paper also suggests a method, namely fractal analysis, which can be used to compare the self‐similarity, or lack thereof, of various organism distributions over a range of scales. Preliminary results seem to indicate a rough correlation between organisms of a small size and those of a larger size, though further data and analysis is necessary for confirmation.

In the San Juan Archipelago (SJA), Washington, red urchins are subject to little predation pressure and are generally exposed and sedentary. Recent research has shown that detached drift algae are common and abundant at all subtidal depths surveyed (&gt;150 m) in the SJA. Here, we investigated whether red urchin feeding rates observed in the laboratory were consistent with field observations of drift capture. Feeding rates were quantified for captive red urchins; from most to least rapidly consumed (grams per hour), these were: Nereocystis luetkeana, Mazzaella splendens, Saccharina sp., Agarum fimbriatum, and Ulva sp. In the field using SCUBA, we repeatedly collected all algae captured by urchins at one-day and six-day intervals within a 25 m2 permanent transect at a depth of 18 m. We identified, blotted, and massed the ‘stolen’ algae to compare taxonomic composition and mass captured over different time frames, assuming that drift held after a longer time period would more closely reflect urchin preference. Results indicate that at least at this site, availability of particular algae is more important in determining overall drift capture rates than is urchin preference. However, captured Agarum constituted a smaller proportion of total algal mass when urchins were given six days to collect drift, indicating that they are likely discarding this alga. This result is consistent with current and previous lab preference studies and suggests that the large quantity of Agarum drift into deep water is a lowquality subsidy, at least for urchins.",,fhl_2012_Roberts_27075.tei.xml

Decreases in pH have been shown to cause deleterious effects on many calcifying marine organisms, which may negatively affect ecosystem functions. Few studies, however, have investigated OA impacts on fertilization success of free-spawning marine organisms. This study focuses on the effects of OA on fertilization success in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. The goal of this study is to experimentally determine whether decreases in pH values lower fertilization success in D. excentricus.

Gametes from adult D. excentricus collected from Crescent Bay, East Sound, Orcas Island, WA, were fertilized in filtered seawater with pH 8.1 and 7.7. Fertilization success was determined by the percentage of 2 and 4-cell cleaving embryos.

Therefore, to accurately predict how species’ ranges will be affected by global climate change, bioclimate models would benefit from knowing the thermal tolerance of different populations within latitudinally distributed species. In this study, the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model system to study how local adaptation influences the cold resistance of isolated populations. Among five populations spanning 18 degrees in latitude, two metrics were used to compare cold tolerance: post-freezing recovery and the temperature of chill coma onset (CTmin). Recovery rates following freezing were faster in copepods from colder northern latitudes. Likewise, northern populations exhibited lower chill coma onset temperatures. Importantly, both metrics showed a consistent latitudinal trend suggesting that any single metric could be used equivalently in future studies investigating latitudinal variation in cold tolerance. Our results provide evidence that populations within a single species can display strong local adaptation to spatially varying climatic conditions.

The interplay between the environment and the biomechanics of morphogenesis can help us understand how development operates in a changing world. Effects of salinity on blastula expansion in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus were used to investigate interactions among the environment, development, and mechanics. Salinity fluctuations, which are common in Dendraster's habitat, affect embryonic cell size. The hyaline layer, an extracellular matrix layer closely associated with the outside of the blastula, is hypothesized to resist blastula expansion. Four models describing how the hyaline layer responds to blastula expansion were compared. In three models the hyaline resists expansion as either an elastic, plastic, or viscous layer. In these models, salinity-driven changes in cell size were predicted to cause changes in the ratio of blastocoel volume to cell volume. In a fourth model, the hyaline is a perfectly accommodating layer that allows the embryo to expand freely as cells divide in a single layer. In this model, salinity changes were predicted not to affect the blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratio. To test these hypotheses, Dendraster embryos were placed in either 25‰ or 32‰ seawater wells and switched to wells of either the same or the other salinity. In a second experiment, Dendraster embryos were raised in 32‰ seawater until the 16-cell stage, at which point a subset of embryos were moved to 25‰ seawater for one cleavage stage and then moved back to 32‰ for the duration of the experiment. In both experiments blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratios were not affected by the salinity treatment. These results suggest that the hyaline layer does not resist blastula expansion in Dendraster, thereby maintaining a constant blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratio, despite salinity variation.",,fhl_2012_Weber_27078.tei.xml
935,University of Washington,Friday Harbor Laboratories,27080,"Bannister, Lilia","Stress, Strain, and Deformation of Chondrichthyan Hyomandibulae During Feeding",2013.0,"The powerful and aggressive feeding habits of various shark species are clear indications that individuals are capable of applying incredible force to their prey. Sharks have been known to crush hard bone and shell (Wroe et al., 2008), and are notorious for their ability to attack and crush large prey. As cartilaginous fishes lacking any hard bone, we sought to study how the jaws of these chondrichthyans are able to withstand such intense pressure while continuing to remain functional and supportive. Of the various cartilages of the jaw, we identified the hyomandibular cartilage of the hyoid arch as our primary focus. The hyoid arch is a modified gill arch that acts as a hinge between the upper and lower jaws (Maisey, 1980). This cartilage is particularly significant as it helps suspend the jaw and allows the other elements of the jaw to function properly and effectively. Differences in pressure of the buccal cavity and pressure produced by the jaw during feeding vary in different types of chondrichthyans. Chondrichthyans feed either by suction feeding, bite feeding, or a mix of both, and jaw structure is crucial to determining which behaviors are implemented (Tomtia et al., 2011). The arrangement of the hyoid arch and the surface area of the cartilages that make up the hyoid arch can help determine what type of feeding a shark uses. For example, by calculating which cartilages have the largest surface area, the relative stiffness of the jaw can be estimated, therefore indicating the most probable type of feeding (Wilga 2008). Cartilage stiffness was tested to determine whether stronger ceratohyal cartilage was present in sharks that suction feed. The stronger the cartilages were, the more force they could withstand during the high pressures that occur during suction (Tomita et al., 2011). The hyoid area, the area made by the opening of the hyoid arch, can provide further insight into the determination of shark feeding (Wilga, 2008). There are five main shapes and orientations of the hyoid in chondrichthyans. They include a posteriorly oriented hyoid, an anteriorly oriented hyoid, and a short, laterally oriented hyoid. Particular positioning and shape of this feature directly affects the size of the jaw opening and buccal cavity. Posteriorly oriented hyoids allow for a very large and wide bite, and are seen in bite feeders. Short, lateral hyoid positions are well suited for cutting back and forth, but do not allow for as large of a bite. This small area creates a better setting for suction feeding and helps create stronger negative pressure inside the buccal cavity to draw in prey. Anteriorly oriented hyoids swing the jaw open much wider so the most amount of water and prey possible can flow into the buccal cavity. This is more often seen in ram and filter feeders (Wilga, 2008). Difference in hyoid orientation is an important distinguishing feature to recognize and can help connect jaw mechanics to ecological scenarios.",,fhl_2013_Bannister_27080.tei.xml
936,University of Washington,Friday Harbor Laboratories,27081,"Brant, Michelle",Copper Rockfish as a den associate: Octopus facilitation of rockfish feeding,2013.0,"Rockfish are a predatory fish often found in the rocky terrain and quick currents of the San Juan channel. They are an active area of study for marine scientists, many seeking to know their food sources for commercial and ecological purposes. The populations of rockfish have been on the decline in the Salish Sea. However, since they are a predatory fish, their trophic interactions are much more difficult to study for conservation purposes. One possible interaction to observe is with a well‐known species of octopus, the giant pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dolfleini). The largest of the octopus species, the GPO (giant pacific octopus) is found in the colder habitats of the northern Pacific, living and hunting in rocky areas. They often bring the prey back to their dens or hunt very close to their dens, creating a flurry of prey tissues and juices, leaving behind midden piles full of leftover food for scavengers. When feeding, the GPO will inject paralyzing venom, liquefying the prey as they rip it apart. The octopus pushes out the pile of rubbish and prey remains from the den to keep its area clean. This flurry of feeding activity creates a prime food source for multiple scavengers and potential prey of the rockfish. Larger fish (such as rockfish) often hunt the scavengers eating among the midden piles; preferring benthic crustaceans, and shrimp. Our aim is to observe whether rockfish take advantage of this phenomenon. We hypothesize that rockfish have a direct feeding relationship with GPOs, using the octopus den as the hub of feeding activity.",,fhl_2013_Brant_27081.tei.xml

The cartilaginous element tested was the hyomandibula in four individuals each of the angel shark, Squatina squatina, spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, and sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus. We put them through trials that tested for strain and we performed geometric morphometric analyses on the results. ! Chondrichthyans have a modified gill arch called the hyoid arch that they use during prey capture and mastication. In all our tested shark species, the cartilaginous hyoid arch expands the buccal cavity. This expansion functions to create negative pressure in the mouth to draw in prey for suction feeders, and allows a wide buccal area to take in as much prey as possible for bite feeders. The hyoid arch in elasmobranchs consists of the ceratohyal, basihyal, and hyomandibula cartilages. The hyomandibula is significant since it connects the ceratohyal to the chondrocranium, connecting functions of the upper and lower jaws. ! Teleosts and elasmobranchs evolved different jaw structures, especially in the hyoid region: teleosts have craniums ossified with dermal bone, with the hyoid arch incorporated into the suspensorium and opercular series. The hyoid expands laterally in teleosts, as shown in previous research with Amia calva and Micropterus salmoides (Wilga 2008), while it compresses in elasmobranchs, except in mako and sandbar sharks (Wilga 2008). Lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks have long, posteriorly oriented hyomandibulae to make room for a wide buccal cavity. Previous research done on buccal pressure shows that lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks do not rely much on suction feeding, but rather on bite feeding (Wilga 2008). Suction feeders, in particular the whitespotted bamboo shark, laterally compress their buccal cavity to generate negative pressure to draw the prey in (Wilga &amp; Sanford 2008). Even the very large megamouth shark uses negative pressure by pulling its basihyal cartilage posteriorly and ventrally rotating its hyoid arch to expand its buccal cavity (Tomita et al 2011). ! All chondrichthyan skeletons are cartilaginous, yet many readily feed on bony teleosts. Some, like the Horned shark, Heterodontus francisci, are durophagous, even with cartilaginous jaws (Huber et al. 2005). Since cartilage is more malleable than bone, the question is brought up as to how chondrichthyans can feed on durable, hard prey with cartilaginous jaws. Hence, our project focuses on the strain levels of the hyoid arch elements in sharks and rays. We tested the hyoid arch since it swings the lower jaw ventrally from the chondrocranium to expand the buccal cavity and experiences much of the pressure from mastication. ! We also examined cartilage mineralization. One suggestion in literature was that the mineralization of cartilage makes it stiffer and therefore more resistant to strain (Porter et al. 2007). Mineralization occurs in chondrichthyan jaws as prismatic or globular calcification in the form of blocks called tesserae. They form around the perichondrium, the outer layer of the extracellular matrix (Dean and Summers 2006). Since the calcified tesserae add another layer to the cartilage, one of our hypotheses was that cartilage elements with more mineralization would be more resistant to strain than those that had a thinner layer of mineralization. ! Our second hypothesis was that shorter, more square-like hyomandibulae would deform less than longer, thinner hyomandibulae. We obtained data on hyomandibulae shape by measuring their length and cross-sectional areas, and used length data to test this hypothesis. We predicted that long, thin specimens had more area to deform than short, squat specimens, leading to a higher Poisson’s ratio of strain. Our third hypothesis was that mineralized area and hyomandibula cross-sectional area were correlated, since a thicker layer of mineralization would add to the extracellular matrix area of the cartilage. Significant correlations would suggest that larger hyomandibulae are more resistant to strain than smaller ones.",,fhl_2013_Hasegawa_27084.tei.xml

In the present study, we investigated the energetic cost of byssus production for the intertidal mussel Mytilus trossulus.

Treatments included: “Never” removing byssus, “Weekly” byssus removal, and “Daily” byssus removal. Using statistical analyses, changes in physical measurements (ie. length, width, and height), gonadosomatic index, and condition index were assessed. We identified a low amount of byssus production for mussels in the “Never” treatment, which corresponded to a lesser percent change in length (shell growth) in comparison to the other treatments. Therefore mussels may shift their energetics from producing longer shells and tissue growth toward applying a greater amount of energy in byssus production.

The abundance of seabirds in 2013 was relatively low, but not anomalously so, and the community composition for this year is consistent with that of past years. Furthermore, analyses of the tidal metrics yielded no evidence of sampling bias. Therefore, it is likely that the interannual patterns observed by PEF in the past are real and are possibly due to global climate patterns.",,fhl_2013_Standish_27091.tei.xml

PSL exhibit a peculiar behavior of actively swimming into sandy substrates as a refuge to avoid predation (Gidmark et al. 2010, Robards 1999, Blaine 2006). A sand wave field was identified in the San Juan Channel, WA in 2004 and discovered to be a suitable habitat for PSL. The San Juan Channel sand wave field is non-uniform and is composed of different substrate types. While physical attributes of the sand wave field have been explored (Greene et al. 2011), there is little known about how PSL use various substrate types as habitat. I am asking the question: How does benthic substrate composition influence the abundance and distribution of Pacific sand lance in the San Juan Channel sand wave? Samples were collected from the San Juan Chanel sand wave with the use of a Van Veen grab. The abundance and size of PSL were examined in each grab as well as the substrate composition. There were apparent trends of PSL abundance decreasing as the amount of gravel increased, and increasing as the amount of sand increased in the sample (Fig 1). Substrate composition seems to not have an influence on PSL size (Fig 3, Fig 4). A map showing the different substrate compositions in different areas of the sand wave in 2013 shows the non-uniform composition of the sand wave (Fig 6).",,fhl_2013_Lopez_27092.tei.xml

Previous Pelagic Ecosystem Function studies have explored the relationship between tidal activity and seabird abundance in the San Juan Channel, Washington, but no strong or consistent temporal patterns were found. My objectives were to investigate: the fine scale temporal changes in bird abundance over the flooding tidal cycle; taxa specific responses to tides; and the influence of other environmental factors on variation among days and between years. I did this through sampling seabird abundance at half-hour intervals during the flooding tide on four consecutive days in the fall of 2013. Seabird abundance results showed consistent response to tidal phase for total birds and alcids in both 2013 and 2012. Variation between years suggested different foraging strategies were used by local gulls based on a change in feeding conditions. Additionally, the variation between years was related to large-scale oceanographic conditions, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The differences in tidal response between taxa and between years suggests that fine temporal scale sampling can provide more insight into previously undetected factors affecting seabird abundance. Based on the results of this study, fine scale sampling can provide better predicting power and thus more informed decisions for management and conservation.",,fhl_2013_Bliss_27093.tei.xml

Variation in tidal conditions thus has important effects on the physical properties of the water in the channel. The objective of this study was to measure these effects on both slack-flood and spring-neap scales of tidal variation. To accomplish this, measurements of physical water properties were taken repeatedly in the same location over the course of a flood tide on four consecutive days. Water density was found to increase as the flood tide progressed within each day, and also as tidal condition changed from neap to spring over the course of the four days. Data taken under similar tidal and seasonal conditions in 2012 did not show the same strong relationship, but given unusually cold water temperatures present in the channel in 2012, this is not inconsistent with the previously stated model of how tidal input affects physical water properties.",,fhl_2013_Schlatter_27094.tei.xml

Population structure and variation through the fall season were compared between populations at the San Juan Channel wave field and Jackson Beach and between past year’s findings (2006, 2010, 2012). The wave field population was significantly larger and was in greater condition than the population at Jackson Beach. Through the fall season for the wave field population: length remained stabled, stomach fullness remained stable, condition factor declined, and CPUE remained stable.

The purpose of this study was to determine the physical oceanographic conditions of 2013, compare them to the 10 previous years of PEF research, and to evaluate the effect of external drivers. The external drivers evaluated were the discharge of the Fraser River, the fall transition from upwelling to downwelling, El Niño Pacific Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Weekly cruises were conducted during the fall of 2013, during which a CTD was used to measure temperature and salinity and to collect water samples for the determination of dissolved oxygen. Results revealed that the Fraser River influence on salinity was heavily affected by wind direction and strength, though the fall transition did not occur within our study period.

The salinity can drop down to as low as 20‰ from the normal level of 30‰ in these fluctuations which usually occur during the summer months when many marine invertebrates are reproducing. Especially affected are echinoderms since they lack the ability to osmo- or ionregulate. In this study we investigated the effects of fluctuating salinity on protein expression in larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus and the seastar Pisaster ochraceus. Adults were spawned and larvae were reared in 2 treatments: control (constant salinity of 29-30‰) and fluctuating salinity (FS, salinity dropped to 21‰ for 2 day periods every ~7 days). Samples were taken periodically, analyzed for protein content by the Bradford Assay, and separated by SDS PAGE to look for differences in banding patterns. A number of differences in protein expression were discovered in both P. ochraceus and D. excentricus larvae exposed to fluctuating salinity but the exact identity of these proteins are not known until mass spectrometry is completed.

The behavior of Pagurus hirsutiusculus differs from that of the other two species in terms of shell selection, escape locomotion, and reactions to predators. Measurements of shells and hermit crab’s occupying them were taken. Both P. granosimanus and P. beringanus were found to select crabs four times their body weight while P. hirsutiusculus chose shells that were slightly lighter than it’s body weight. However, gravid females of P. hirsutiusculus choose shells twice their weight. Shell release is a unique behavior in P. hirsutiusculus in which the crab will let go of it’s shell when picked up the shell and fall out. This behavior was tested for on the other species of the intertidal, but it was found that only a large percentage of P. hirsutiusculus display this behavior. Gravid females of P. hirsutiusculus were less likely to display shell release behavior. Behavior between P. granosimanus and P. hirsutiusculus in presence of a predator was drastically different. P. hirsutiusculus recovered twice as quickly from being startled than P. granosimanus. There was no significant difference in control or predator water for either hermit crab in Cancer productus water.

Greater body stiffness results in greater mechanical outputs from the body on the environment. Previous work in bioinspired systems has shown that changing the length of the intervertebral joint changes the mechanics of the whole column. Our goals were to test the effects of centrum morphology and intervertebral joint length on mechanical outputs of the vertebral column using bioinspired models. We expected that centrum angle, joint length, and bending angle would all be significant effects in our statistical models. We designed five 3-D models inspired by vertebral morphology of fishes, humans, and marine mammals, and models were printed on a 3-D printer. We constructed 12 motion segments (centrum – joint – centrum) of varying joint length for each centrum morphology. A moment arm was added to one end of the motion segment to insure pure bending and eliminate shear. We tested mechanical properties of motion segments on a materials testing system measuring force (N). From the force outputs we calculated moment (Nm), Work (J), and Bending Stiffness (Nm2). Increasing the bending angle during testing, increased the moment and work produced by the system, while it decreased the bending stiffness. By increasing joint length we measured decreases in each of those mechanical properties. The marine marine mammal models, regardless of joint length, always had the largest mechanical outputs while the fish model with an intermediate centrum angle had the lowest. These data suggest that convex and flat models are consistently stiffer than concave models. Our data show the relation between centrum shape, joint length, and their associated mechanical outputs is perhaps not linear. Building additional models will allow us to further explore morphospace and better understand the conserved centrum shapes we see in among vertebrate groups.

Animals may use their compass navigation to fix their position and determine their direction of movement. Oftentimes, a variety of complementary tools like, celestial cues may be used to assist compass navigation (Hill et al. 2012). These navigational abilities can promote reproductive success, food acquisition, and effective migration. While compass navigation and orientation behavior has been well studied in birds (Wiltschko &amp; Wiltschko 1972), sea turtles (Lohmann 1991), and other organisms, the underlying neural basis of these behaviors is less understood. In investigating the neurophysiology of vertebrate navigation, the animal is restrained and thus limited in exhibiting typical migratory behavior. Additionally, the complexity of vertebrate brain structure makes it difficult to identify specific neurons and neural circuits involved in navigation. The large nudibranch mollusk, Tritonia tetraquetra is known to orient to the Earth’s magnetic field (Lohmann and Willows 1987). It has been hypothesized that T. tetraquetra use their magnetic sense in response to situations when primary navigational cues become undependable (Wyeth 2010). T. tetraquetra uses odor-gated rheotaxis (OGR) to detect predators, mates, and prey (Wyeth &amp; Willows 2006). But, sometimes before the slug reaches the source of the odor, the odor plume may dissipate due to varying water flow direction. The slug may then benefit from switching to a secondary navigational tool, such as, magnetoreception (Wyeth 2010) when the odor cue is lost. T. tetraquetra is a good model for studying the behavior and neural basis of navigation and magnetic sensing. Their navigational distances are short compared to Morgan D. Linney 3 other animals, allowing behavioral experiments to be done in the lab. Additionally, they have a centralized nervous system with large orange and white neurons that make them easy to visualize and identify (Willows 1971). The majority of their neurons have been mapped and characterized. Past studies of the neural basis of T. tetraquetra magnetic sensing has begun to identify key neurons and potential uses of this navigational tool (Lohmann et al. 1991).",,fhl_2013_Linney_27103.tei.xml

Low tide conditions may be stressful for seaweeds because desiccation and extreme light levels may impact their ability to photosynthesize. We examined the effect of low tide exposure on the photosynthetic health of the canopy-forming seaweed Saccharina sessilis in the field and lab. Field studies assessed the health of marked individuals on days with varying environmental conditions, while lab studies separated the effects of those different conditions. We hypothesized that the seaweed’s photosynthetic health depended on weather. We predicted that health would decline over a single stressful low tide (high light, high wind, and high temperature), but not over a benign low tide (low light, low wind, and moderate temperature). We assessed health in multiple ways. First, we measured dark-adapted Maximum Quantum Yield (MQY) via pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry, which assesses the photosynthetic ability of Photosystem II. Second, because we observed that the seaweed changes color following intense stress, we evaluated tissue damage by quantifying the proportion of blade area in five color categories. A single stressful low tide can reduce MQY readings to 25% of pre-exposure values and damage 60% of a blade’s area. Individuals in benign conditions had MQY values of 97% of pre-exposure values and only 1% of blade area damage.

Low tide stressors include, but are not limited to, temperature fluctuations and wind desiccation. Saccharina sessilis provides a canopy for intertidal animals to escape to during these warm, stressful low tides. Some of these animals include herbivores of S. sessilis : K. tunicata, I. wosnesenskii, and Lacuna species snails. This macroalgae will accumulate damage over a tide series. The focus of this study looks at whether being damaged will alter S. sessilis susceptibility to herbivory. First we assessed S. sessilis risk of herbivory in the field at Pile Point, WA by counting the number of S. sessilis, K. tunicata, I. wosnesenskii, and Lacuna in a given area in the S. sessilis zone. Next, we carried out stress/no stress trials where we simulated a low tide and either desiccated samples of S. sessilis or left them out of water. Both treatments lasted either 60 or 90 minutes. Area, wet weight, and percent brown were measured before and after each simulation Data showed the stressed samples lost more mass, area, and accumulated more visible damage than the not stressed samples. We then put these paired samples though herbivory trials in a container without herbivores or with a set of herbivores (K. tunicata, or I. wosnesenskii). Once 50% of the S. sessilis tissue in the herbivore container was consumed, the trial was terminated for the pair of containers. The area and wet weight of the remaining tissue was measured before and after the herbivore trials. Analysis showed that K. tunicata preferred damaged S. sessilis tissue over undamaged tissue and that I. wosnesenskii had no preference for damaged or undamaged S. sessilis tissue. Overall, we conclude that repeated wind exposure leads to shrinking algae, and ultimately their algal canopy. We also conclude that S.sessilis’s susceptibility to herbivory is sensitive to the differences of the feeding preferences of its herbivores.",,fhl_2013_Pineda_27172.tei.xml

Gastrulation is a very important morphological change as the vegetal plate of an embryo buckles inward to form the archenteron, which eventually forms the larval gut. However, successful gastrulation isn’t always the case and defects arise. A defect known as exogastrulation occurs when exposed to particular pollutants. A calcium deficient environment is one of those stimuli that can induce exogastrulation. In this study, embryos were exposed to varying salinity and calcium conditions and the archenteron lengths were measured near the end of the gastrulation process. The blastocoel and cell layer volumes were also collected to determine if the blastocoel was expanding at the same rate that the cell layer was expanding at. It was hypothesized that the rate of expansion would be a causing factor for whether an organism underwent successful gastrulation or exogastrulated.

Changes in tooth morphology during the experiment was different for snails from two source locations, False Bay, an eelgrass bed, and Pile Point, which is dominated by macroalgae, which may reflect different prior environmental variability or stability. Most animals of both species produced pointed teeth on the neutral diet of lettuce, as well as when fed kelp or eelgrass, suggesting this is a default morphology, and blunt tooth production requires a cue for production. Our data suggest that alginate is not a neutral carrier for food, and affected the rate of tooth change.

Physical sediment samples were collected for grain-size analysis, CobbleCam autocorrelation was used to obtain mean grain size from digital photographs, and beach profiles were constructed for these periods of spring tides and large waves. Results indicate that the upper foreshore of the transect farthest from the river mouth (Line 198) lost up to 0.38 m of elevation between the two study periods, and the lower foreshore gained up to 0.41 m elevation. In addition, slope breaks on all transects migrated cross-shore, and foreshore sediments coarsened, both temporally (during the three-day April sampling period) and spatially (down the foreshore).

Mud was found just outside the river mouth and to the west, and more sand was found in Freshwater Bay than had been prior to dam removal. Farther from the river mouth and to the east, there was mostly gravel and some sand, but little to no mud. It appears that in areas of higher gravel and sand fractions, there were more species found, as well as more total counts of benthos. In muddy areas there were little to no benthos found, which implies that the benthos are being smothered or migrating away from the areas with the most mud accumulation.

Focusing on the cheilostome, Membranipora membranacea, we used time lapse movies to test whether there were contractions/dilations of funicular strands, as expected if muscular pumping were to move material through the strands, and to test whether cells or large vesicles moved directionally along the strands, potentially carrying nutrients. Neither contractions/dilations of the funicular strands, nor persistent movement of particles or other features along the strands, were visible in time lapse videos (10 to 120 min at 4 to 10 sec per frame). The only visible movements were rare back-and-forth movements along the strands, or shaking of the strands.

Both fluorescein (367 Da; as sodium salt) and fluorescein-dextran (70,000 Da) moved between individuals; however 2.0μm fluorescent polystyrene beads did not. The fact that both fluorescein and fluorescein-dextran were transported suggests that transmembrane channel or transporter proteins are not required for transport; however there may be an upper size limit (&lt;2μm) caused by something other than the pore itself.

The experiments here sought to test this cue-switching hypothesis by demonstrating a response to a local distortion in the geomagnetic field. However, the behavioral response observed was an increased turning frequency upon loss of an initial attractive odor, independent of magnetic distortion, which is inconsistent with the hypothesized straight, geomagnetic-guided crawling.

Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator’s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume ∝ length3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force ∝ muscle cross-sectional area ∝ length2). Since suction volume increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Two ways to counteract this deficit are to increase muscle mass or increase skeletal leverage within the jaw. In this study, we examined musculoskeletal variation in anatomy and kinematics across an ontogenetic series in the suction-feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Our results show that great sculpin mandibles change shape as they grow, increasing jaw-closing muscle leverage, which counters the force deficit (N = 6, p = 0.0456). Kinematic results agree: a given amount of muscle strain produces less jaw displacement in larger fish (N = 6, p &gt; 0.00015). We did not find disproportionate changes in muscle mass with size (N = 7, p=.514). Smaller fish, therefore, rely on high-velocity jaw closing whereas larger fish rely more on high forces to close the jaw. We hypothesize that a smaller fish needs high speed to reduce the risk of prey escape from a small suction volume, whereas a large fish needs high forces to move the disproportionately large volume of water.",,fhl_2014_Conrades_27202.tei.xml

We examined burying efficiency in and preference among five natural sediments for two crab species – Metacarcinus magister (the Dungeness crab), a habitat specialist and Cancer productus (the red rock crab), a habitat generalist. Crab burial speeds and sediment stiffnesses were measured at five field sites. Dungeness crabs buried equally well in less stiff, well-sorted sands and more stiff, poorly-sorted mud/cobble mixtures. At all sites they buried more quickly than red rock crabs whose performance decreased with increasing heterogeneity of the sediment. These results are contrary to expectations based on reported habitat specificity of the two species. Burial speed decreased with increasing carapace size especially for red rock crabs. The burial success and speed of Dungeness crabs is associated with the relatively larger surface area of their propoduses and the sharper angle formed by the posterior border of the carapace and abdomen. In replicate mesocosms, crabs explored five substrates and then buried in one. Dungeness crabs tended to select well-sorted sediments similar to where we found them in the field. In contrast, red rock crabs were least likely to bury in the mud/cobble sediment in which they had the most difficulty burying although this sediment was typical of the field site where they were most common.

We limited the movement of certain earwigs while allowing others to move freely within artificial arenas to examine choice and competition. Our results revealed strong sexual selection for larger sizes through both competition and choice, but there was no preference based on forceps asymmetry. We found significant results in all four trial types, including not only the more traditional male competition and female choice, but also female competition and male choice. However, competition trials yielded our most compelling results. This complex, multidimensional mating system is likely driven by competitive forces and highly influenced by factors determining dominance in intraspecific competition.",,fhl_2014_Kendall-Bar_27206.tei.xml

Lab studies have shown that this fish can adhere to smooth and rough surfaces as well as slippery and non-slippery surfaces. Now, the aim of the current study is to define the habitat of the Northern Clingfish and compare habitat parameters with these previous lab studies. We show that the clingfish is presented with a challenging, slippery habitat We find that nearly 90% of the rocks present in the habitat of the clingfish are covered in biofilm and are consequently slippery. Clingfish cope with their habitat by seeking shelter under rocks within a specific size range (15-45 cm in width) and they are most commonly found under rocks that have gravel as the main substrate. Rocks that clingfish were found under possessed a wide range of aufwuchs (periphyton) cover.

In extinct organisms, physiological data must be inferred from bone structure, or muscles scars, even in the most exceptionally preserved specimens (Benton, 2010). However even reconstruction and analysis of muscle scars in fossils rely heavily on assumptions (Rieppel, 2002). Given the resilient nature of enamel, teeth are often the most commonly found remains of extinct organisms, and in some cases they are only known remains (Adnet et al., 2009; Pol, 2012). Enamel is highly calcified and so, unlike other softer portions of an organism’s anatomy, is readily preserved (Lucas et al., 2008). Fortunately, there is a close relationship between tooth form and function, which allows researchers to infer the ecology of the extinct organisms. Slender, pointed teeth, are ideal for puncturing, and bladed teeth are best suited for tearing and cutting prey, whereas more rounded and blunt teeth are thought to function better in crushing prey (Massare, 1987), a feeding strategy termed durophagy. Durophagous predators typically have robust jaw bones in addition to their distinctive and molariform teeth on the premaxilla, maxilla, dentary or the pharyngeal (Norton, 1988, Wilga and Motta, 2000). It is thought that this molariform tooth morphology, as well as tooth arrangement, may serve to increase tooth surface area, thus reducing the stress applied to teeth (Ramsay and Wilga, 2007) when crushing. Studies on the functional ability and structure of durophagous teeth have focused on a range of both extinct and extant organisms, including borophagines canids, early hominoids, and elasmobranchs (Lee et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2008; Tseng ZJ and Wang X, 2010). For these groups, tooth form dictates diet and, by extension, habitat selection and population ecology. From there it is possible to study large-scale evolutionary patterns, co-evolutions, and trophic interactions (Lauten 2013).",,fhl_2014_Lomax_27208.tei.xml

Increased temperature causes ice extent to decrease worldwide (IPCC, 2013). Glacier runoff during the spring and summer months increases the amount of freshwater pouring into the ocean creating salinity fluctuations. Surface salinity in the ocean can drop from~30ppt to ~21ppt. These fluctuations affect many marine organisms such as the sea star Pisaster ochraceus that cannot osmoregulate. P. orchraceus produces planktotrophic larvae that will also endure the fluctuations of salinity. The present study investigated whether differences in occurrence and intensity of salinity fluctuations at two locations in the Pacific Northwest cause sea stars to produce eggs and larvae with different protein profiles. Eggs and larvae from Snug Harbor with less influx of fresh water from the Fraser River and Cantilever Point with more, were exposed in the laboratory to two and four salinity fluctuations respectively during their development. Low salinity varied between 20 and 22 ppt and high salinity between 30 and 32 ppt. The length, width, and stomach width were noted and protein profiles obtained for larvae in control and fluctuating salinity treatments. Significant differences were observed between treatments for larvae from Snug Harbor, a site less influenced by the Fraser River. Larvae in the controls were significantly bigger than those reared in fluctuating salinity. No significant differences in larval size were observed for larvae from Cantilever Point, a site that experiences a significant influx of low salinity waters from the Fraser River several times during the summer months. Greater expression of a high molecular weight protein (&gt;300kDa) was observed for eggs produced by females from Cantilever Point than for eggs produced by females from Snug Harbor. Larvae from both locations expressed this high molecular weight protein. Larvae from the two locations differed in mid-range to low molecular weight proteins. The High molecular weight proteins might be a kind of ATPase pump, while the low to intermediate size proteins might be used for cell signaling or heat shock proteins that will help protein folding during stressful events of low salinity",,fhl_2014_Maciel_27209.tei.xml

We compared the species composition of the epibiotic community on gastropod shells to that of colonizers on neighboring rock surfaces to determine whether intertidal zone, wave action, or basibiont identity affected the epibionts present. We examined two tidal heights (a lower Saccharina sessilis zone and a higher Fucus gardneri/Semibalanus cariosus zone) at three sites of varying wave exposure (Westside Preserve, Cattle Point, and Colin’s Cove) on San Juan Island, WA. In the lower tidal zone (but not in the higher), the percent of unfouled snails was much greater than predicted based on the surrounding substratum. Fewer than four algal species dominated the substratum at both tidal heights, but the identity of the dominant algae differed between tidal heights and did not match the dominant epibiotic species. Instead, small individuals of the barnacles Semibalanus cariosus and Balanus glandula, spirorbid worms, an excavating alga, an excavating sponge, and diatoms were the most prevalent epibionts. While the basibiotic gastropods were less fouled than we expected overall, we found heavily-fouled individuals (especially limpets) interspersed among unfouled individuals. We deployed cleaned empty shells, either sanded (“weathered”) or intact, of the gastropod species Tectura scutum, Lottia digitalis, Nucella canaliculata, and Nucella lamellosa for 3 to 6 weeks in the higher intertidal zone and subtidally at two sites.

Ocean acidification decreases the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater, and imposes increased energy costs on organisms that deposit calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Larval stages of these organisms are especially vulnerable to stresses of acidification and nutrition, which may have a common energetic basis. We investigated how acidification and nutrition affected pre-competent larval growth of the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata during the first 8 days after hatching. We also asked if a four-day period of food and/or acidification stress, applied to older competent larvae, affected speed of metamorphosis and juvenile growth after stresses were relieved. Treatments in both experiments used all 4 combinations of pH 7.8 or 7.4, and high or low food concentration (15x104 or 1x104 cells/ml Isochrysis galbana). Lower food level in the pH 7.8 treatments resulted in decreased growth rates for pre-competent larvae (p&lt;0.0001), while larvae failed to grow in the pH 7.4 treatments regardless of food level. Competent larvae were unaffected by either pH or nutrition level over the course of a four-day stress period indicated by their inability to grow. Increased acidification extended the latency of KCl-induced metamorphosis in the second experiment (p &lt; 0.0309), but nearly all larvae completed metamorphosis within 24 hours.

Some species live on both solid and sedimentary substrates, although how these substrate generalists resist detachment from materials with fundamentally different mechanical properties is not well studied. We used field observations and flow tank experiments to compare the capabilities and tactics of Haminoea vesicula, an opisthobranch gastropod, when exposed to destabilizing flow on its native sand and eelgrass. Velocities of outgoing and incoming spring tides in the tidal creeks and over and within eelgrass beds where H. vesicula live at False Bay, San Juan Island, WA ranged from 1 to 30 cm/s. In a flow tank, snails’ resistance to current depended on substrate and orientation. On eelgrass, snails moving into flow maintained their position at velocities exceeding 40 cm/s, but were more vulnerable when facing away or sideways to flow (falling off at mean velocities of 25 and 32 cm/s respectively). In the latter orientation, snails would often rotate into flow by hooking onto the leading edge of eelgrass with the anterior edge of the cephalic shield. In this position, snails resisted flows exceeding 40 cm/s. Snails crawling on sediment and exposed to turbulent flow drew sediment-encrusted mucus sheets dorsally, completely ensheathing their bodies. “Sheeting” significantly increased snails’ effective weight and ability to resist flow. On sand, snails ensheathed in sediment were least stable in the sideways orientation compared to those facing into or away from flow (mean velocities of 13 vs. 20 and 23 cm/s). Experiments on sandpaper indicated that snails were destabilized on sediment due to failure of adhesion of the sedimentary layers beneath them rather than their attachment to the sand.",,fhl_2014_Sui_27212.tei.xml

We used ImageJ to measure the area eaten from each leaf and calculated feeding rates. The feeding preferences of Ariolimax columbianus were consistent across size classes and source populations., and the two color morphs and various source populations of Arion rufus were also largely consistent within this species.

The goals of this study were to answer (1) what are the relevant wave forces acting upon the fish on the San Juan Island and (2) how do changing water levels and thus daily time spent under water percentages (DTUW%) affect their distribution? Dynamometers were built and distributed at 3 locations on the San Juan Island to measure the maximum wave velocities. Results show that over all, wave velocities acting on the island do not exceed 4m/s. Clingfish may have the ability to withstand higher velocities than those measured. A transect was set up at the Reuben Tarte (RT) beach and fish distribution was recorded during the lowest tides between June 30, 2014-July30, 2014. Water heights to reach MLLW were calculated at RT using the law of cosine and these values were later correlated to NOAA’s daily water levels to find DTUW%.

With the removal of two dams on the Elwha River, it was hypothesized that chronic erosion of the surrounding coastline would slow or reverse. To test the impact of dam placement and removal on shoreline change, shoreline change was quantified by digitizing shoreline position using a 1908 survey map and four aerial photographs spanning 1939-2014. Anthropogenic and natural features related to shoreline change were identified using a combination of aerial photographs, remotely-sensed data and field surveys. Shoreline change analysis revealed retreat of the vegetation line east of the river mouth both before and during dam removal and areas of net accretion to the west. However, for ~1 km east of the river mouth during dam removal, new sediment accreted along the shoreline where vegetation retreated. Although this indicates that in some places movement of the vegetation line is not a reliable proxy for shoreline change, it also reveals that dam removal has not slowed erosion in all areas of the eastern coastline. Local wave regimes and the locations of abandoned river channels, levees, and shoreline armoring correlate spatially with calculated patterns of shoreline change.

Pre-dam removal monitoring has characterized substrate and community composition but uncertainties on the extent of deposition and resulting community responses to increased deposition remain. The relationship between acoustic backscatter of the seabed, seafloor substrate, and macrofaunal habitat was examined using sidescan sonar data and physical grab samples taken on the Elwha delta. Backscatter intensity analysis was combined with grain-size distribution allowing for classification of ‘suitable’ versus ‘probably suitable’ habitat. Habitat suitability pre and post dam removal was determined based on shifts in substrate on the subaqueous delta following dam removal. Acoustic backscatter results suggest an increase in fine-grain sediment, increasing the area of unsuitable habitat by 0.7 km2 since pre-dam removal conditions. Physical grab samples taken pre-dam removal reveal seafloor substrate was composed of primarily of gravel and sand, whereas post-dam removal conditions to date were characterized by sand and mud. Grain-size analysis from 2014 suggests a continuation of the shift toward fine-grained sediment. In the short-term it appears sediment supply in post-dam removal conditions is high enough to support the accumulation of mud on the delta, modifying the seafloor substrate and likely resulting in loss of kelp habitat.

Reservoirs behind the dams are known to be both carbon sinks and sources. The Elwha dam removals in Washington State are the largest dam removals in U.S. history. In this study the fate of the carbon stored in the reservoirs upon its abrupt release is evaluated. Sediment samples from the estuary, delta and water column were tested for their particulate organic carbon content through loss-on-ignition testing. Grain sizes of sediment samples were analyzed and volume estimates of carbon deposits were calculated. The results indicated that particulate organic carbon was preferentially deposited in two locations. The large woody debris typically settled on the subaerial delta, while the carbon sorbed to silt and clay settled in the estuary and subaqueous delta. The sudden release of the reservoirs resulted in a condition where river meandering through the former reservoir beds is minimal. As a result, approximately half of the carbon likely sorbed to the sediment in the reservoirs remains. The rapid sediment accumulation resulted in a higher-than-average carbon burial rate of the roughly 165,000 +/- 124,000 tonnes of carbon deposited on the delta. This suggests dam removal can not only restore an ecosystem and may also be able to help mitigate climate change.",,fhl_2014_Tekola_27247.tei.xml

The nutritional value of fresh Nereocystis luetkeana and Saccharina latissima were compared to that of feces from urchins fed the same algal species in a set of population growth and dietary preference experiments using the copepod species Tigriopus californicus. Population growth rates were not recorded due to massive mortalities; however, significant copepod preference for urchin feces over both algal species was observed.

Sea urchin feces, in the form of detritus, may provide an energetic link to benthic communities with no primary productivity. Urchins are known to have an inefficient digestive system which leaves the potential for high food value in feces. I conducted a series of tests on the relative caloric contents of algae and urchin feces. First, I measured the biomass consumed and egested by urchins. Secondly, I quantified the caloric content of aged and fresh feces of 10 urchins fed diets of either Nereocystis luetkeana or Saccharina latissima. For both kelp diets, the caloric content of algal material increased after being consumed by urchins, and the longer the urchin feces aged, the higher the caloric value became.

We found more total colonizers of beach wrack in treatments that included larger invertebrates. The community structure of colonizers shifted with site, and in treatments that included large amphipods there was more mass loss of algae due to herbivory. In wrack with more ephydridae larvae, mass loss was more uniform between treatments.

Because longer wavelengths of light are available at shallower depths in additions to shorter wavelengths, it was hypothesized that kelp species generally inhabiting shallower water (e.g., Alaria marginata) would have a phototropic response to red (720-740 nm), green (520-540 nm), and blue (420-440 nm) light. Species generally inhabiting deeper water (e.g., Agarum fimbriatum) would have a stronger negative phototropic response in the blue wavelength of the light in comparison to A. marginata and other color treatments. Kelp haptera were isolated and exposed to unidirectional red, green, and blue light for 16 days. Controls were exposed to unidirectional sunlight or no light. The hypothesis was mostly confirmed. The blue light exposure showed the highest phototropic response in both species, but a higher relative response in A. fimbriatum. Alaria marginata haptera responded to all wavelengths of light.

This study investigated the composition and implications of this mysterious gelatinous tissue in one of the planet’s deepest-living fishes. Gel tissues from eight deep water species were analyzed for water content, ionic composition, and osmolality. Bulk protein, lipid, and carbohydrate assays were also conducted. These analyses do not support the hypotheses that this tissue plays a role in nutrient storage or buoyancy. The gelatinous layer is most obvious in the hadal snailfish Notoliparis kermadecensis, making it an appropriate model organism to investigate gel function. The authors propose that the gelatinous tissue that surrounds the fish’s muscle may act as an energetically inexpensive method of increasing swimming efficiency. To test this hypothesis, swimming performance in the gelatinous hadal snailfish was compared to swimming performance in the tidal snailfish, Liparis florae, which have similar morphology, but with no subcutaneous gel. Video analyses show that Liparis florae swam more body lengths per second than their hadal counterparts.

All three species have different disc morphology (Fig. 1); E. orbis and L. florae have much large papillae than G. maeandricus and a more rigid support to their disc which may help to explain the difference in disc performance. Papillae may increase friction which prevents the disc from slipping and rigid pelvic spines resist bending of the disc. Both E. orbis and L. florae seem to use abduction of their pelvic fins and operculum to brace themselves as they pull back the anterior edge of their disc, causing failure and allowing the disc to be peeled back in the anterior direction.

Under stressful conditions such as increased levels of pCO2, anemones expel their algal symbionts causing the anemones to rely more heavily upon heterotrophic feeding. A heavier reliance on heterotrophic feeding could be accomplished by increasing the density of nematocysts. Anthopleura elegantissima individuals were collected from the Friday Harbor Laboratories shoreline (48° 32.7646 N, 123° 00.5932 W), Washington in June 2014, and the number of nematocyst per μg of protein was measured to determine if increasing oceanic pCO2 levels will affect the density of nematocysts. The number of nematocyst per μg of protein was measured again after 7 days in higher (2200 μatm) or ambient (700 μatm) pCO2 conditions.

1044,University of Washington,Friday Harbor Laboratories,27276,"Rummel, Andrea",Flexion of hydroid colonies in a current,2014.0,"Suspension feeding is a common feeding strategy among small sessile invertebrates. While active suspension feeders use metabolic energy to draw water through their feeding apparatus, passive suspension feeders depend on local currents to feed (Sponaugle and LaBarbera 1991). Erect colonies of passive suspension feeders therefore face a potential contradiction: how to increase the feeding surface such that sufficient flow will occur, while keeping drag forces on the feeding modules and colony low? Flexibility is a feature of many sessile organisms, and a strategy for dealing with drag: bending or stretching with the current allows for a morphological reconfiguration that alters the drag footprint of the animal. Vogel (1984) argues that this shape deformation can be adaptively useful, and is not necessarily merely a consequence of drag force on the organism. Several studies have investigated the effects of drag on Cnidarian colonies. Harvell and LaBarbera (1985) find that the natural flexibility of Abietenaria rigida (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) colonies reduced drag on and velocity around polyps, in contrast to artificially stiffened colonies, which experienced a much greater drag force. Sponaugle and LaBarbera (1991) find that flexion in Gorgonian colonies in flow appears to function at least in part to reduce local flow velocity around polyps. Other studies (e.g. Hunter 1989) highlight the importance of flow velocity, directionality, and colony architecture in different flow regimes. This study aims to address questions of flexion in the hydroid Obelia geniculata Linnaeus 1758 (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa).",,fhl_2014_Rummel_27276.tei.xml

Comparing the data to the survey results from 2012 and 2013, 2012 had a much higher density of seabirds than in 2013 and 2014. The community composition of the seabirds in the region remained steady over the three years. There is no apparent trend for the aggregation of birds in certain zones within the transect.

Total abundance was assessed along with location in the bay, habitat type, water depth, and tide phase and height for each individual. We assessed strike rate success for individuals, noting the five criteria above as well. The results from foraging observations indicated that herons at False Bay had greater strike rate successes behind the tideline and in deeper water, and during higher and flood tides. Such success patterns could relate to prey abundance, size, and profitability. We also found the success rate of individual herons to be greater when foraging alone or in groups of six or more. These success patterns could be due to competition factors, as well as herons using one another as indicators of food availability. Additionally, we found heron abundance and success rate appear inversely related in some cases, which may be related to prey depletion.

There was a clear diurnal pattern of abundance during both of the days used for data analysis. The abundance was very low in the morning which may be a result of the nighttime/early morning foraging behavior characteristic of Steller Sea Lions. It was determined that this variation in haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions did not occur in response to changes in tidal height. The data also suggest that air temperature may play a role in determining the total abundance of Steller Sea Lions. The second study was done to understand how two unrelated bird species, Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), compare and contrast in their use of the Cattle Pass rocky intertidal habitat post-breeding season. It was found that Black Oystercatchers spend most of their time loafing in the region while Harlequin Ducks spend most of their time swimming and foraging.

Disturbances, in this study, include sailboats, motorboats, wake height, and distance of boats to haul-out sites (0 to 200 m). Harbor seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and regulations set by the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), state that no vessels should approach closer than about 100 m to marine mammals. During our study, we observed 41/71 boats that passed within 100 m of the harbor seals on their haul-out site. We recorded disturbance behavior of harbor seals as vigilance and flushing and recorded their location on the haul-out site as low, waterline to 1 m, and high as any seals above 1 m. Our results indicate that in general, seals below 1 m are more vigilant. During wake disturbances, we recorded a mean vigilance of about 40.2% as compared to those about 1 m up on the haul-out site with a mean vigilance of 8.6% . Again, seals were more vigilant in low areas when comparing distances of boats to vigilance. Out of all the disturbances (i.e. sailboats, motor boats, and wakes), wakes causes the highest amount of vigilance.

We used focal individual and scan samples of harbor seals off of Yellow Island, WA to examine any possible differences in vigilance between the two seal categories at low tides. The result of overall vigilance rates for the seals was inconclusive. However, we did find that mother seals tend to be more vigilant the higher the tide goes, while lone adults had no change. This signifies that the less haul out space available, the more vigilant mothers become. Also, mothers spend less time loafing overall than lone adults and more time swimming, possibly due to the fact they are teaching their young feeding techniques. The data on vigilance rates being relatively equal between the two seal categories is inconsistent with prior studies, possibly due to smaller number of sample days. Overall, this study shows that while vigilance does not change much for mothers, they do spend more time exhibiting other active behaviors and less time resting than lone adults.",,fhl_2014_Furr_27283.tei.xml

Three identical traps were deployed at three different habitats: intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal. The first was pulled up after 6 hours, the second after 12 hours, and the third after 24 hours. All of the species within each trap were counted, identified, recorded, and entered into Primer and Excel to determine the differences between the habitats, the species richness and diversity for each depth, and the percent bait consumption to determine scavenging rates. The results showed that scavenger species varied noticeably at different depths. The shallow subtidal had the highest scavenger diversity and fastest consumption rates. It also seems apparent that scavenging rates in the intertidal are slowest. Therefore, the habitat would probably be most affected by large carrion debris due to slow decomposition, but it would affect upper trophic levels more slowly than in the other habitats.

In this study, I present concrete evidence showing that the hull does reduce the sinking rates of eggs in the chiton species Mopalia ciliata, acting as flotation device, as a consequence of its lower density compared to sea water and the egg without this structure. Additionally, changes during ontogeny in behavior, swimming velocities, and body shape of the larvae of this species were analyzed. Over time, the larvae decrease their tendency to swim up and prefer to stay in the bottom, and the body becomes elongated. These changes may be related to preparation for settle and metamorphosis into a juvenile.

In this study adults and egg masses of the sacogloassan sea slug, Alderia modesta (Lovén 1844), were subjected to acute salinity stress to determine the consequences for reproduction and embryonic development to hatching, respectively. New egg masses that had been laid at constant salinity were exposed to varying salinity (7-37ppt) stress within 12 hours of deposition. Adults were exposed to varying salinity while reproducing and the egg masses they subsequently produced were compared between ambient and experimental conditions. Hatching success of eggs was significantly higher at intermediate salinities, with zero hatching success at the lowest salinity treatment (7ppt), and delayed development with low (10%) success at the highest treatment.

Almost all early stage larvae swam up to the top in the first hour, but in later stages larvae changed their swimming pattern to swim down or sink. Upward velocity averaged at about 2mm per second and decreased over time, and in the fourth hour the larvae started to sink at about 2mm per second. In addition, there is no significant difference among the values of the lengths or widths of the larvae over time, but these phenotypic characteristics did vary within the age cohorts.",,fhl_2014_Rebolledo_27300.tei.xml

However, it is difficult to substantiate this hypothesis because we lack comparative data on mortality rates of unprotected (e.g., not in egg capsules or gelatinous masses) embryos and larvae on the benthos and in the water column. The aim of this study was to provide some of this missing information, by comparing development success in benthic and pelagic environments. Dendraster excentricus embryos were placed in enclosed development chambers under three treatment conditions: 1) directly on the substratum (unscreened benthic), 2) on a screen on the substratum (screened benthic), and 3) on a screen raised 3 cm above the substratum (screened pelagic). Development success for pelagic embryos was consistently higher than those on the benthos, substantiating the hypothesis that embryos experience a release from predation as they move off the benthos. In addition, the screened benthic treatment had significantly higher development success than the unscreened benthic treatment, indicating that macro-predators (&gt;55 μm) may significantly reduce development success for unprotected larvae. Higher development success of protected pelagic treatments may have been due to lower abundances of pelagic micro-predators or anoxic conditions on the benthos.",,fhl_2014_Sloan_27301.tei.xml

If populations are unable to recover quickly, SSWS is likely to cause significant changes to rocky intertidal and subtidal community structure and functioning in the Northeast Pacific ocean. Recovery will likely depend in large part on the success of larval recruitment, but the impacts of SSWS on larvae are unknown. We raised embryos and early stage P. ochraceus larvae in treatments of sea water that varied in filtration exposure to potential pathogens of SSWS. We assessed treatment impacts on larval survival development and larval size. We found a significant effect of water treatment and filtration level on two measures of larval survival.

These sensory organs detect environmental cues that initiate and regulate settlement within a favorable habitat. However, these organs may also allow the larvae to perceive unfavorable habitat and avoid predation. This study looked at the settlement response of the competent larvae of Bugula c.f. californica when they came in contact with traces of a predatory nudibranch, Janolus fuscus, with a known positive settlement cue (biofilm), and with traces of a non-predatory nudibranch, Archidoris montereyensis. A known number of larvae were kept in small petri dishes filled with filtered seawater at about 12 degrees Celsius with no flow inside the dishes. Prior to adding the newly released larvae, the petri dishes were divided into four groups that were smeared with the three following treatments: mucus from the predatory nudibranch, mucus from the non-predatory nudibranch, and a thin layer of biofilm. Clean (un-filmed) dishes with FSW served as the control. A second study looked at preferential settlement with the known positive- biofilm, the biofilm substratum with predatory water, and 1⁄2 biofilm substratum next to 1⁄2 predatory mucus substratum. We found that the larvae in the biofilm with FSW settled early in their planktonic period. The larvae in the dishes with predator mucus, dishes with biofilm and predator water, in dishes with a choice of biofilm or predator mucus delay their settlement- perhaps in search of optimal habitats. Furthermore, when the biofilm and predator mucus exist in the same dish, the larvae preferentially settle in the side with biofilm, which suggests that they try to avoid potential predation.",,fhl_2014_Lu_27303.tei.xml

These organisms belong to the phylum Echinodermata, which include sea cucumbers, sand dollars and sea urchins. The sea star Pisaster ocharaceus is native to the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Northern Alaska to Northern California. They appear in different color morphs, ranging from purple to orange and even brown. Like other sea stars they have tube feet, which give them the ability to move and secure themselves on any surface, making it difficult for predators, including humans to obtain it. They normally thrive on common bivalves such as muscles, but also consume barnacles and chitons, however during their larval stage they mostly feed on algae. Using their tube feet they can latch on to different prey and bring them to their mouth to feast. Pisaster ochraceus is known to have its mating Pisaster sea stars have separate sexes, which can be determined by making a slight incision at the base of the arm and locating the gonads, which will contain either sperm or eggs. . Many sea stars have the capacity to regenerate body parts lost during their lifetime, but only in their adult stages. However, I am more interested in learning about this mechanism during their larval stage. Not only does regeneration affect different organs in the specimen, but also different cells (Carnevali 2006). This paper will show the processes of obtaining the specimens, bisecting the larval sea stars, and finally displaying them in different colors, allowing viewers to not only see the common organs such as the mouth, anus, esophagus and stomach, but also different muscle tissues. In this study, we investigate the regenerative abilities of 200 larvae bisected in various morphological planes and fixed over a series of time points to observe the progress of each bisected culture.",,fhl_2012_Walker_27304.tei.xml

Recently, the genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, a member of the early branching metazoan linage ctenophora, has been sequenced. Insights into the function of the Wnt pathway in P. bachei will provide information on early evolution of this key pathway. Three Wnt ligand genes were identified in P. bachei and cloned for in situ hybridization. These genes showed expression in the combs, tentacles, mouth, ciliated grooves and polar fields of the adult P. bachei. In a genomic search for other members of the canonical Wnt pathway, components of the destruction complex and antagonists were incomplete or missing from the genome.

Specifically, we studied the effects of habitat amelioration by Saccharina sessilis and Fucus distichus on L. scutum populations. We hypothesized that in the F. distichus zone (during the low tide), predation would be high in open areas (because limpets in these areas are visible to foraging bird predators), and that predation would be low under the F. distichus canopy (because limpets would be hidden from bird predators during low tide exposure). Secondly, we hypothesized that in the S. sessilis zone, predation would be higher under the canopy (because sea stars commonly reside under the canopy to avoid stress from the low tide (Burnaford, 2001) 4 than in open areas during the high tide. Additionally, we investigated how long it takes L. scutum to recover from heat stress and regain their escape responses after low tide exposure. We predicted that limpets exposed to cooler low tides (simulating conditions under a shaded algal canopy) would recover their escape responses faster than limpets exposed to warm low tides (simulating conditions in open sun-exposed intertidal areas).",,fhl_2013_Gomez_27306.tei.xml

Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator’s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume ∝ length3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force ∝ muscle cross-sectional area ∝ length2). Since suction volume increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Previous studies show that great sculpin counter the force deficit with increased jaw leverage and more force production at longer fish lengths. In this study, we examined muscle force and muscle strain variation across sizes in the suction- feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Because muscles are subject to the limitations of the length-tension relationship, we saw maximum force (P0) production at intermediate muscle lengths (L0) and declining forces at longer/shorter muscle lengths. Our results show that great sculpin maintain a constant amount of muscle strain to achieve at least 50% of their maximum force (P0) throughout ontogeny. As the great sculpin grows, it uses a wider range of this available muscle strain in feeding, stretching its muscles away from L0 and losing force in the process. Thus in addition to an increasing muscle force deficit, larger great sculpin experience declining jaw-closing forces due to the length-tension properties of jaw- closing muscles.",,fhl_2014_Conrades_27311.tei.xml

Wrack can also provide food and habitat for meiofauna that help transfer nutrients up the food web. These interactions have been examined on sandy beaches, but not on gravel beaches. I examined the relationship between beach wrack type, nutrient leaching, and meiofauna colonization on a gravel beach in San Juan County, WA. I used three different types of wrack: Fucus disticus, Zostera marina, and leaves from Prunus avium (Cherry). I conducted two different experiments: a nutrient leaching experiment by measuring nitrate and phosphate leaching from wrack over seven weeks relative to seawater controls with daily tidal simulation, and a community composition experiment using wrack-­‐filled packets placed on a gravel beach. Both nitrate and phosphate showed similar patterns across all wrack types. Nitrate was absorbed by all wrack types at the beginning of the experiment, released in the middle, then absorbed again at the end. Phosphate was absorbed by Zostera and Fucus (though released by cherry) at the beginning, then released by all types of wrack, then all types had similar nutrients as seawater. Diversity of meiofauna was significantly correlated with final weight of the wrack inside the packets. Diversity of meiofauna changed significantly across type of wrack by date sampled.

We were able to determine the lethal and near-sublethal temperature for Olympia oysters in a three-day heat shock as 41°C and 36°C, respectively. When analyzing mortality, our experiment yielded ambiguous statistical results but did indicate that oysters pretreated in low pH conditions may have less mortality in a lethal heat shock than oysters in high pH conditions.

The onset of ocean acidification has decreased the aragonite saturation states across the globe. While studies along the Washington coast have documented widespread pteropod dissolution during peak upwelling season, the state of pteropods during other seasons is unknown (Bednarsek et al 2014). Pteropods exposed to pCO2 levels that exist within the Puget Sound have experienced dissolution in situ, but there has been no study done to date that examines the state of pteropods in the Puget Sound (Busch et al 2014).

Gut content analyses reveal that Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring feed primarily on calanoid copepods, while the surf perch has a more varied diet. Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring had low values on Levins’ standardized measure of niche breadth, indicating a narrow dietary breadth characteristic of a specialized diet. Surf perch had a higher value, indicating a wider dietary breadth and more generalist feeding approach. Morista’s measure of niche overlap was used to quantify dietary overlap between the species. Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring had a high rating, which could indicate competition for the same prey items.

The goals of this study were to answer (1) what are the relevant wave forces acting upon the fish on the San Juan Island and (2) how do changing water levels and thus daily time spent under water percentages (DTUW%) affect their distribution? Dynamometers were built and distributed at 3 locations on the San Juan Island to measure the maximum wave velocities. Results show that over all, wave velocities acting on the island do not exceed 4m/s. Clingfish may have the ability to withstand higher velocities than those measured. A transect was set up at the Reuben Tarte (RT) beach and fish distribution was recorded during the lowest tides between June 30, 2014-July30, 2014. Water heights to reach MLLW were calculated at RT using the law of cosine and these values were later correlated to NOAA’s daily water levels to find DTUW%. Clingfish were found exclusively in areas that had at least 80 DTUW% which leads to the conclusion that water levels and thus DTUW% are important determinants in clingfish survival.",,fhl_2014_Truong_34525.tei.xml

We conducted transect studies in three habitats (cedar forest, Doug fir forest, and grasslands) on San Juan Island, WA, to examine the relative demographics of these slugs and note possible food sources. Utilizing those data, we conducted feeding preference studies across leaves from 16 local plant species, incorporating slugs from the two species from different source habitats, different size classes, and both the black and brown morphs of Arion rufus, which tend to specialize in different habitats. We used ImageJ to measure the area eaten from each leaf and calculated feeding rates. The feeding preferences of Ariolimax columbianus were consistent across size classes and source populations, and the two color morphs and various source populations of Arion rufus were also largely consistent within this species.

Some species live on both solid and sedimentary substrates, although how these substrate generalists resist detachment from materials with fundamentally different mechanical properties is not well studied. We used field observations and flow tank experiments to compare the capabilities and tactics of Haminoea vesicula, an opisthobranch gastropod, when exposed to destabilizing flow on its native sand and eelgrass. Velocities of outgoing and incoming spring tides in the tidal creeks and over and within eelgrass beds where H. vesicula live at False Bay, San Juan Island, WA ranged from 1 to 30 cm/s. In a flow tank, snails’ resistance to current depended on substrate and orientation. On eelgrass, snails moving into flow maintained their position at velocities exceeding 40 cm/s, but were more vulnerable when facing away or sideways to flow (falling off at mean velocities of 25 and 32 cm/s respectively). In the latter orientation, snails would often rotate into flow by hooking onto the leading edge of eelgrass with the anterior edge of the cephalic shield. In this position, snails resisted flows exceeding 40 cm/s. Snails crawling on sediment and exposed to turbulent flow drew sediment-encrusted mucus sheets dorsally, completely ensheathing their bodies. “Sheeting” significantly increased snails’ effective weight and ability to resist flow. On sand, snails ensheathed in sediment were least stable in the sideways orientation compared to those facing into or away from flow (mean velocities of 13 vs. 20 and 23 cm/s). Experiments on sandpaper indicated that snails were destabilized on sediment due to failure of adhesion of the sedimentary layers beneath them rather than their attachment to the sand.",,fhl_2014_Sui_34527.tei.xml

Ocean acidification decreases the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater, and imposes increased energy costs on organisms that deposit calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Larval stages of these organisms are especially vulnerable to stresses of acidification and nutrition, which may have a common energetic basis. We investigated how acidification and nutrition affected pre-competent larval growth of the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata during the first 8 days after hatching. We also asked if a four-day period of food and/or acidification stress, applied to older competent larvae, affected speed of metamorphosis and juvenile growth after stresses were relieved. Treatments in both experiments used all 4 combinations of pH 7.8 or 7.4, and high or low food concentration (15x104 or 1x104 cells/ml Isochrysis galbana). Lower food level in the pH 7.8 treatments resulted in decreased growth rates for pre-competent larvae (p&lt;0.0001), while larvae failed to grow in the pH 7.4 treatments regardless of food level. Competent larvae were unaffected by either pH or nutrition level over the course of a four-day stress period indicated by their inability to grow. Increased acidification extended the latency of KCl-induced metamorphosis in the second experiment (p &lt; 0.0309), but nearly all larvae completed metamorphosis within 24 hours. Together, acidification and low food availability decreased subsequent juvenile growth in the first 6 days after metamorphosis (p&lt;0.01), demonstrating latent effects of larval experience.",,fhl_2014_McMahon_34528.tei.xml

We compared the species composition of the epibiotic community on gastropod shells to that of colonizers on neighboring rock surfaces to determine whether intertidal zone, wave action, or basibiont identity affected the epibionts present. We examined two tidal heights (a lower Saccharina sessilis zone and a higher Fucus gardneri/Semibalanus cariosus zone) at three sites of varying wave exposure (Westside Preserve, Cattle Point, and Colin’s Cove) on San Juan Island, WA. In the lower tidal zone (but not in the higher), the percent of unfouled snails was much greater than predicted based on the surrounding substratum. Fewer than four algal species dominated the substratum at both tidal heights, but the identity of the dominant algae differed between tidal heights and did not match the dominant epibiotic species. Instead, small individuals of the barnacles Semibalanus cariosus and Balanus glandula, spirorbid worms, an excavating alga, an excavating sponge, and diatoms were the most prevalent epibionts. While the basibiotic gastropods were less fouled than we expected overall, we found heavily-fouled individuals (especially limpets) interspersed among unfouled individuals. We deployed cleaned empty shells, either sanded (“weathered”) or intact, of the gastropod species Tectura scutum, Lottia digitalis, Nucella canaliculata, and Nucella lamellosa for 3 to 6 weeks in the higher intertidal zone and subtidally at two sites.

Increased temperature causes ice extent to decrease worldwide (IPCC, 2013). Glacier runoff during the spring and summer months increases the amount of freshwater pouring into the ocean creating salinity fluctuations. Surface salinity in the ocean can drop from~30ppt to ~21ppt. These fluctuations affect many marine organisms such as the sea star Pisaster ochraceus that cannot osmoregulate. P. orchraceus produces planktotrophic larvae that will also endure the fluctuations of salinity. The present study investigated whether differences in occurrence and intensity of salinity fluctuations at two locations in the Pacific Northwest cause sea stars to produce eggs and larvae with different protein profiles. Eggs and larvae from Snug Harbor with less influx of fresh water from the Fraser River and Cantilever Point with more, were exposed in the laboratory to two and four salinity fluctuations respectively during their development. Low salinity varied between 20 and 22 ppt and high salinity between 30 and 32 ppt. The length, width, and stomach width were noted and protein profiles obtained for larvae in control and fluctuating salinity treatments. Significant differences were observed between treatments for larvae from Snug Harbor, a site less influenced by the Fraser River. Larvae in the controls were significantly bigger than those reared in fluctuating salinity. No significant differences in larval size were observed for larvae from Cantilever Point, a site that experiences a significant influx of low salinity waters from the Fraser River several times during the summer months. Greater expression of a high molecular weight protein (&gt;300kDa) was observed for eggs produced by females from Cantilever Point than for eggs produced by females from Snug Harbor. Larvae from both locations expressed this high molecular weight protein. Larvae from the two locations differed in mid-range to low molecular weight proteins. The High molecular weight proteins might be a kind of ATPase pump, while the low to intermediate size proteins might be used for cell signaling or heat shock proteins that will help protein folding during stressful events of low salinity",,fhl_2014_Maciel_34530.tei.xml
1098,University of Washington,Friday Harbor Laboratories,34531,"Lomax, JJ; Crofts, Stephanie",Importance of being organized: the effects of changing tooth arrangement on durophagous predation,2014.0,"The literature on paleontology and functional morphology both include many studies on the feeding mechanics of organisms. In extinct organisms, physiological data must be inferred from bone structure, or muscles scars, even in the most exceptionally preserved specimens (Benton, 2010). However even reconstruction and analysis of muscle scars in fossils rely heavily on assumptions (Rieppel, 2002). Given the resilient nature of enamel, teeth are often the most commonly found remains of extinct organisms, and in some cases they are only known remains (Adnet et al., 2009; Pol, 2012). Enamel is highly calcified and so, unlike other softer portions of an organism’s anatomy, is readily preserved (Lucas et al., 2008). Fortunately, there is a close relationship between tooth form and function, which allows researchers to infer the ecology of the extinct organisms. Slender, pointed teeth, are ideal for puncturing, and bladed teeth are best suited for tearing and cutting prey, whereas more rounded and blunt teeth are thought to function better in crushing prey (Massare, 1987), a feeding strategy termed durophagy. Durophagous predators typically have robust jaw bones in addition to their distinctive and molariform teeth on the premaxilla, maxilla, dentary or the pharyngeal (Norton, 1988, Wilga and Motta, 2000). It is thought that this molariform tooth morphology, as well as tooth arrangement, may serve to increase tooth surface area, thus reducing the stress applied to teeth (Ramsay and Wilga, 2007) when crushing. Studies on the functional ability and structure of durophagous teeth have focused on a range of both extinct and extant organisms, including borophagines canids, early hominoids, and elasmobranchs (Lee et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2008; Tseng ZJ and Wang X, 2010). For these groups, tooth form dictates diet and, by extension, habitat selection and population ecology. From there it is possible to study large-scale evolutionary patterns, co-evolutions, and trophic interactions (Lauten 2013). To understand the relationship between form and function in the teeth of extinct organisms, physical models can be constructed to test the limitations of these structures either through fossil re-creation or inference from testing on extant relatives. Single cusped mammalian teeth (Lee et al., 2011), flat surfaces of the labially compressed bamboo shark teeth (Shimada et al., 2009), and teeth with varying concavities representative of eels (Crofts and Summers, 2014), have all been created and tested on an individual basis. These studies found that a single concave tooth required more force to fracture prey than a convex tooth, and Lee et al. (2011) found that a domed tooth surface works well to strengthen the overall tooth structure. However, Ramseys and Wilga (2007) posit that many teeth contacting prey simultaneously could be vital for durophagy, since multiple contact points will serve to spread bite force over a larger surface area. Most modelling studies, to date, focus on the functional morphology of a single tooth, not the effects of multiple teeth on a prey item. While there are a number of durophagous lineages, all specialized on the same hard-prey consuming life-style, the arrangement of teeth varies between species. For example, ancient durophagous elasmobranchs such as Ptychodus occidentalis exhibit cusped teeth of the dentary premaxilla and maxilla in rows similar to modern carnivorous sharks (Shimada et al., 2009). In contrast, Megapiranah paranensis, an extinct Serrasalmid, has a staggered, zig-zag dentition on the oral jaws (Grubich et al., 2012). Some durophagous teleost fishes have completely skipped the oral jaws and use flattened pharyngeal tooth plates for crushing (Hernandez and Motta, 1997). Similarly the extinct marine Sauropterygians, the Placodonts, also evolved tooth plates, but on completely different bones. Those goals of this study are: (i) to determine how tooth arrangement affects the ability to crush a simplified prey item, (ii) to test if and how the effects of tooth arrangement vary with tooth occlusal morphology, and (iii) to determine if crushing idealized prey items is a feasible proxy for natural prey items.",,fhl_2014_Lomax_34531.tei.xml

We examined the roles of these two factors, body size and forceps asymmetry, as it relates to four types of sexual selection; female choice, male choice, male competition, and female competition. We limited the movement of certain earwigs while allowing others to move freely within artificial arenas to examine choice and competition. Our results revealed strong sexual selection for larger sizes through both competition and choice, but there was no preference based on forceps asymmetry. We found significant results in all four trial types, including not only the more traditional male competition and female choice, but also female competition and male choice.

The most common feeding technique among vertebrates is suction feeding, in which an animal rapidly expands its buccal cavity to create negative pressure and suck in prey. Suction feeders not only open their jaws quickly; they must also close them rapidly to prevent elusive prey from escaping. In this study, we compared jaw morphology and feeding kinematics of five species of Salish Sea sculpin. We used anatomical dissection to measure differences in jaw adductor morphology and jaw leverage, and we used Sonometric crystal implantation to measure gape change and muscle strain during feeding. Although we found high conservation of body length to muscle mass ratio among species, visual inspection of the head and jaw revealed important differences. We found that the red Irish lord (Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus) possessed the fastest jaw, as demonstrated by anatomical measurement of a small lever ratio, kinematic measurement of a large gape-change to muscle-strain ratio, and behavioral observation of the red Irish lord’s ambush hunting strategy.

We examined burying efficiency in and preference among five natural sediments for two crab species – Metacarcinus magister (the Dungeness crab), a habitat specialist and Cancer productus (the red rock crab), a habitat generalist. Crab burial speeds and sediment stiffnesses were measured at five field sites. Dungeness crabs buried equally well in less stiff, well-sorted sands and more stiff, poorly-sorted mud/cobble mixtures. At all sites they buried more quickly than red rock crabs whose performance decreased with increasing heterogeneity of the sediment. These results are contrary to expectations based on reported habitat specificity of the two species. Burial speed decreased with increasing carapace size especially for red rock crabs. The burial success and speed of Dungeness crabs is associated with the relatively larger surface area of their propoduses and the sharper angle formed by the posterior border of the carapace and abdomen. In replicate mesocosms, crabs explored five substrates and then buried in one. Dungeness crabs tended to select well-sorted sediments similar to where we found them in the field. In contrast, red rock crabs were least likely to bury in the mud/cobble sediment in which they had the most difficulty burying although this sediment was typical of the field site where they were most common.

Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator’s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume ∝ length3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force ∝ muscle cross-sectional area ∝ length2). Since suction volume increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Two ways to counteract this deficit are to increase muscle mass or increase skeletal leverage within the jaw. In this study, we examined musculoskeletal variation in anatomy and kinematics across an ontogenetic series in the suction-feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Our results show that great sculpin mandibles change shape as they grow, increasing jaw-closing muscle leverage, which counters the force deficit (N = 6, p = 0.0456). Kinematic results agree: a given amount of muscle strain produces less jaw displacement in larger fish (N = 6, p &gt; 0.00015). We did not find disproportionate changes in muscle mass with size (N = 7, p=.514). Smaller fish, therefore, rely on high-velocity jaw closing whereas larger fish rely more on high forces to close the jaw. We hypothesize that a smaller fish needs high speed to reduce the risk of prey escape from a small suction volume, whereas a large fish needs high forces to move the disproportionately large volume of water.",,fhl_2014_Gidmark_34537.tei.xml

However, it remains unclear by which mechanism this sensory information is integrated into motor commands. Additionally, the purpose for a response to magnetic stimuli has yet to be determined. While it is hypothesized that the sea slug sometimes uses a cue-switching mechanism to navigate, ultimately relying on the magnetic field for orientation, laboratory experiments thus far have failed to demonstrate this behavior. The experiments here sought to test this cue-switching hypothesis by demonstrating a response to a local distortion in the geomagnetic field. However, the behavioral response observed was an increased turning frequency upon loss of an initial attractive odor, independent of magnetic distortion, which is inconsistent with the hypothesized straight, geomagnetic-guided crawling. Additionally, in electrophysiological experiments ciliary motor neurons Pd5 and Pd6, as well as sensory nerve CeN1, failed to demonstrate a response to rotations of the magnetic field, despite previous evidence that these units are involved in T. tetraquetra’s magnetic response.

However a complex of cells appears to plug the pores that connect individuals. Focusing on the cheilostome, Membranipora membranacea, we used time lapse movies to test whether there were contractions/dilations of funicular strands, as expected if muscular pumping were to move material through the strands, and to test whether cells or large vesicles moved directionally along the strands, potentially carrying nutrients. Neither contractions/dilations of the funicular strands, nor persistent movement of particles or other features along the strands, were visible in time lapse videos (10 to 120 min at 4 to 10 sec per frame). The only visible movements were rare back-and-forth movements along the strands, or shaking of the strands. We injected materials that differed in molecular/particle size to investigate the specificity of transport at pore plates. Both fluorescein (367 Da; as sodium salt) and fluorescein-dextran (70,000 Da) moved between individuals; however 2.0μm fluorescent polystyrene beads did not. The fact that both fluorescein and fluorescein-dextran were transported suggests that transmembrane channel or transporter proteins are not required for transport; however there may be an upper size limit (&lt;2μm) caused by something other than the pore itself. Our results are consistent with some transport mechanisms (e.g. paracellular diffusion or transcytosis at the pore plate) but inconsistent with others (muscularly-pumped flow along funicular strands, cell crawling, or transmembrane transport via transporter or channel proteins).",,fhl_2014_Beaver_34540.tei.xml

Reservoirs behind the dams are known to be both carbon sinks and sources. The Elwha dam removals in Washington State are the largest dam removals in U.S. history. In this study the fate of the carbon stored in the reservoirs upon its abrupt release is evaluated. Sediment samples from the estuary, delta and water column were tested for their particulate organic carbon content through loss-on-ignition testing. Grain sizes of sediment samples were analyzed and volume estimates of carbon deposits were calculated. The results indicated that particulate organic carbon was preferentially deposited in two locations. The large woody debris typically settled on the subaerial delta, while the carbon sorbed to silt and clay settled in the estuary and subaqueous delta. The sudden release of the reservoirs resulted in a condition where river meandering through the former reservoir beds is minimal. As a result, approximately half of the carbon likely sorbed to the sediment in the reservoirs remains. The rapid sediment accumulation resulted in a higher-than-average carbon burial rate of the roughly 165,000 +/- 124,000 tonnes of carbon deposited on the delta.

This study looks at the effects of the increased sediment budget on comparative grain-size and topographical and bathymetry profiles of two transect lines, east and west of the Elwha River mouth. We found a higher accumulation of sediment on the East transect versus the West transect which is likely due to the oblique wave angle on the delta and net alongshore transport to the east. The morphology of the East transect line after dam removal changed to a steeper slope which could be caused from the increased sediment being deposited faster than it can be eroded.

Acoustic backscatter results suggest an increase in fine-grain sediment, increasing the area of unsuitable habitat by 0.7 km2 since pre-dam removal conditions. Physical grab samples taken pre-dam removal reveal seafloor substrate was composed of primarily of gravel and sand, whereas post-dam removal conditions to date were characterized by sand and mud. Grain-size analysis from 2014 suggests a continuation of the shift toward fine-grained sediment. In the short-term it appears sediment supply in post-dam removal conditions is high enough to support the accumulation of mud on the delta, modifying the seafloor substrate and likely resulting in loss of kelp habitat. Whether these trends persist and kelp is permanently displaced remains unknown.",,fhl_2014_Lawrence_34562.tei.xml

The Elwha Case Study,2030.0,"Dam construction on rivers like the Elwha River in Washington State reduces sediment supply to adjacent coastal systems and has often been linked to coastal erosion and threats to human infrastructure. With the removal of two dams on the Elwha River, it was hypothesized that chronic erosion of the surrounding coastline would slow or reverse. To test the impact of dam placement and removal on shoreline change, shoreline change was quantified by digitizing shoreline position using a 1908 survey map and four aerial photographs spanning 1939-2014. Anthropogenic and natural features related to shoreline change were identified using a combination of aerial photographs, remotely-sensed data and field surveys. Shoreline change analysis revealed retreat of the vegetation line east of the river mouth both before and during dam removal and areas of net accretion to the west. However, for ~1 km east of the river mouth during dam removal, new sediment accreted along the shoreline where vegetation retreated. Although this indicates that in some places movement of the vegetation line is not a reliable proxy for shoreline change, it also reveals that dam removal has not slowed erosion in all areas of the eastern coastline. Local wave regimes and the locations of abandoned river channels, levees, and shoreline armoring correlate spatially with calculated patterns of shoreline change. This suggests the importance of considering all of the potential geologic and anthropogenic influences when predicting shoreline responses to major disturbances such as dam removal.",,fhl_2014_Holmberg_34563.tei.xml

The Elwha River was dammed from 1910 to 2011, and construction of the dams has been attributed to coarsening and erosion of its delta and adjacent shorelines. In turn, the habitat made available to marine organisms was altered for nearly 100 years. This study examined the median (D50) of the grain sizes, sand fractions, and respective elevations of physical samples from the Elwha delta using dry and wet sieve methods, as well as average surface grain sizes using photographic methods, to evaluate the impacts of dam removal of the restoration and/or expansion of Pacific sand lance (sand lance) spawning habitat. Of the 34 physical samples collected and as of 12 and 13 April 2014, the findings suggest 10 sample locations west and 8 samples locations east of the river mouth met the three parameters documented as preferred sand lance spawning habitat. Each of the 18 locations within the study area had grain-size distributions with medians ranging between ~0.2 and 2.0 mm, the bulk sand fractions of each sample ranged between ~60 and 98%, and their respective elevations were between +1.33 and +2.22 m MLLW.

Dam removal began in 2011, releasing sediment into the Elwha River, forming a pronounced river plume. It is important to evaluate the response of the river ecosystem to such a drastic change. We examined light attenuation associated with the plume, using photosynthetically-active radiation measurements along with suspended sediment concentrations. Results suggest that there is not enough light penetrating depths of 5 m for successful primary production of some species. Suspended sediment in the water column prohibits light penetration &gt; 10% water depth. As a result, the habitat of Z. marina, a local sea-grass species requiring a minimum of 18.6% light penetration, is likely affected.

During a recent dam removal project on the Elwha River, kelp densities in the sub-tidal region declined. In this study we evaluate trends in kelp growth since dam removal on the Elwha River began, using dive surveys from 2010 to 2013, and relate these trends to long-term river turbidity and light intensity data obtained during a 3-day study period in April 2014.

Because longer wavelengths of light are available at shallower depths in additions to shorter wavelengths, it was hypothesized that kelp species generally inhabiting shallower water (e.g., Alaria marginata) would have a phototropic response to red (720-740 nm), green (520-540 nm), and blue (420-440 nm) light. Species generally inhabiting deeper water (e.g., Agarum fimbriatum) would have a stronger negative phototropic response in the blue wavelength of the light in comparison to A. marginata and other color treatments. Kelp haptera were isolated and exposed to unidirectional red, green, and blue light for 16 days. Controls were exposed to unidirectional sunlight or no light. The hypothesis was mostly confirmed.

We found more total colonizers of beach wrack in treatments that included larger invertebrates. The community structure of colonizers shifted with site, and in treatments that included large amphipods there was more mass loss of algae due to herbivory. In wrack with more ephydridae larvae, mass loss was more uniform between treatments.

Secondly, I quantified the caloric content of aged and fresh feces of 10 urchins fed diets of either Nereocystis luetkeana or Saccharina latissima.

Under stressful conditions such as increased levels of pCO2, anemones expel their algal symbionts causing the anemones to rely more heavily upon heterotrophic feeding. A heavier reliance on heterotrophic feeding could be accomplished by increasing the density of nematocysts. Anthopleura elegantissima individuals were collected from the Friday Harbor Laboratories shoreline (48° 32.7646 N, 123° 00.5932 W), Washington in June 2014, and the number of nematocyst per μg of protein was measured to determine if increasing oceanic pCO2 levels will affect the density of nematocysts. The number of nematocyst per μg of protein was measured again after 7 days in higher (2200 μatm) or ambient (700 μatm) pCO2 conditions.

By living together in dense groups, barnacles can change their local flow environment, potentially altering the behavior or energetics of their neighbors. In this study, I recorded video of small aggregations of the barnacle Balanus glandula and studied whether or not individuals responded to adjacent barnacles in their active feeding behavior by either maintaining synchrony or asynchrony in cirral beating. I found that barnacles do not exhibit any behavior that suggests sensitivity to neighbors’ cirral positions, and that the difference in beating phase between actively feeding individuals follows a periodic function as would be expected when comparing the phase of the two individuals beating independently.",,fhl_2014_Geoga_34621.tei.xml

Sexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but there was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack of difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is no character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference for the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely due to the ease of consumption.

The snails collected from the beach in front of the Friday Harbor Laboratories are of the thick-shelled variety of N. lamellosa and are known to exhibit a row of teeth within their apertural openings, presumably as a defense against their predator, Cancer productus. I collected 25 of these snails at low tide and took systematic measurements (length, width, weight) to quantify shell size, and I used high resolution images of the apertural openings to measure average tooth height and apertural lengths. I found that, while a majority of the snails (19 out of 25) displayed apertural teeth, there were 5 snails that did not (one snail exhibited drastically different morphology). Of the range of shell lengths I collected (1.03 cm – 5.84 cm), the largest snail without apertural teeth was 1.93 cm. By comparing shell width and weight to shell length, I determined that there was no significant difference between the way snails with and without apertural teeth developed; both groups showed a significant positive correlation between shell width and weight and shell length.

Total abundance was assessed along with location in the bay, habitat type, water depth, and tide phase and height for each individual. We assessed strike rate success for individuals, noting the five criteria above as well. The results from foraging observations indicated that herons at False Bay had greater strike rate successes behind the tideline and in deeper water, and during higher and flood tides. Such success patterns could relate to prey abundance, size, and profitability. We also found the success rate of individual herons to be greater when foraging alone or in groups of six or more. These success patterns could be due to competition factors, as well as herons using one another as indicators of food availability.

During our study, we observed 41/71 boats that passed within 100 m of the harbor seals on their haul-out site. We recorded disturbance behavior of harbor seals as vigilance and flushing and recorded their location on the haul-out site as low, waterline to 1 m, and high as any seals above 1 m.

During wake disturbances, we recorded a mean vigilance of about 40.2% as compared to those about 1 m up on the haul-out site with a mean vigilance of 8.6% . Again, seals were more vigilant in low areas when comparing distances of boats to vigilance. Out of all the disturbances (i.e. sailboats, motor boats, and wakes), wakes causes the highest amount of vigilance.

We used focal individual and scan samples of harbor seals off of Yellow Island, WA to examine any possible differences in vigilance between the two seal categories at low tides. The result of overall vigilance rates for the seals was inconclusive. However, we did find that mother seals tend to be more vigilant the higher the tide goes, while lone adults had no change. This signifies that the less haul out space available, the more vigilant mothers become. Also, mothers spend less time loafing overall than lone adults and more time swimming, possibly due to the fact they are teaching their young feeding techniques. The data on vigilance rates being relatively equal between the two seal categories is inconsistent with prior studies, possibly due to smaller number of sample days. Overall, this study shows that while vigilance does not change much for mothers, they do spend more time exhibiting other active behaviors and less time resting than lone adults.",,fhl_2014_Furr_34629.tei.xml

There was a clear diurnal pattern of abundance during both of the days used for data analysis. The abundance was very low in the morning which may be a result of the nighttime/early morning foraging behavior characteristic of Steller Sea Lions. It was determined that this variation in haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions did not occur in response to changes in tidal height. The data also suggest that air temperature may play a role in determining the total abundance of Steller Sea Lions. The second study was done to understand how two unrelated bird species, Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), compare and contrast in their use of the Cattle Pass rocky intertidal habitat post-breeding season.

All of the species within each trap were counted, identified, recorded, and entered into Primer and Excel to determine the differences between the habitats, the species richness and diversity for each depth, and the percent bait consumption to determine scavenging rates. The results showed that scavenger species varied noticeably at different depths. The shallow subtidal had the highest scavenger diversity and fastest consumption rates. It also seems apparent that scavenging rates in the intertidal are slowest. Therefore, the habitat would probably be most affected by large carrion debris due to slow decomposition, but it would affect upper trophic levels more slowly than in the other habitats.

However, it is difficult to substantiate this hypothesis because we lack comparative data on mortality rates of unprotected (e.g., not in egg capsules or gelatinous masses) embryos and larvae on the benthos and in the water column. The aim of this study was to provide some of this missing information, by comparing development success in benthic and pelagic environments. Dendraster excentricus embryos were placed in enclosed development chambers under three treatment conditions: 1) directly on the substratum (unscreened benthic), 2) on a screen on the substratum (screened benthic), and 3) on a screen raised 3 cm above the substratum (screened pelagic). Development success for pelagic embryos was consistently higher than those on the benthos, substantiating the hypothesis that embryos experience a release from predation as they move off the benthos. In addition, the screened benthic treatment had significantly higher development success than the unscreened benthic treatment, indicating that macro-predators (&gt;55 μm) may significantly reduce development success for unprotected larvae. Higher development success of protected pelagic treatments may have been due to lower abundances of pelagic micro-predators or anoxic conditions on the benthos.",,fhl_2014_Sloan_34644.tei.xml

In this study, I present concrete evidence showing that the hull does reduce the sinking rates of eggs in the chiton species Mopalia ciliata, acting as flotation device, as a consequence of its lower density compared to sea water and the egg without this structure. Additionally, changes during ontogeny in behavior, swimming velocities, and body shape of the larvae of this species were analyzed. Over time, the larvae decrease their tendency to swim up and prefer to stay in the bottom, and the body becomes elongated. These changes may be related to preparation for settle and metamorphosis into a juvenile.

Freshwater input from rain and run off is one such stress. Salinity changes have been shown to have adverse developmental effects on embryos of intertidal organisms. Although these organisms have developed different mechanisms by which larvae and embryos cope with stresses, relatively little has been demonstrated on the range of environmental stresses the eggs are able to tolerate. In this study adults and egg masses of the sacogloassan sea slug, Alderia modesta (Lovén 1844), were subjected to acute salinity stress to determine the consequences for reproduction and embryonic development to hatching, respectively. New egg masses that had been laid at constant salinity were exposed to varying salinity (7-37ppt) stress within 12 hours of deposition. Adults were exposed to varying salinity while reproducing and the egg masses they subsequently produced were compared between ambient and experimental conditions. Hatching success of eggs was significantly higher at intermediate salinities, with zero hatching success at the lowest salinity treatment (7ppt), and delayed development with low (10%) success at the highest treatment. When exposed to the same acute salinity stresses, adults did not lay egg masses so no comparative data was collected. These results show tolerance to and development in lower salinity than previous studies, providing evidence that successful reproduction might be less restricted by conditions of embryonic development.",,fhl_2014_Parker_34648.tei.xml

Field methods, such as tethering, have provided indispensable measurements of mortality under natural conditions for the larvae of benthic invertebrates. However, few such field studies have examined mortality rates of benthic invertebrates' early life stages in size classes less than 1 mm. Here, we tethered egg capsules to quantify how rates of predation vary with environmental gradients, especially distance from the benthic substratum and flow velocity. We found that predation is consistently high on L. scutulata egg capsules and invariant at four positions in the water column and on the benthic substratum (average 34% loss across all treatments). Instead, the flow environment had the greatest effect on predation rate. We hypothesize that higher predation in the faster flow environment was due to higher encounter rates with advected predators.",,fhl_2014_Orzechowski_34649.tei.xml

Costs of being in the plankton include increased susceptibility to advection away from habitat and starvation. Potential benefits include reduction in predation for pelagic larvae. Few studies have measured predation rates on larvae in the field. Even fewer have directly observed larval predation events, documented the specific predator, mode of predation, and intervals between predator attacks. In this study we investigated benthic and pelagic differences in predator assemblage and predation interval on megalopae of the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. To observe the predation events, we combined methods of tethering larvae with automated motion analysis of underwater camera images from daytime deployments off the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories, Friday Harbor, WA. We measured number of predation events, the interval in which those events happened, the species of predator, and of other non-predator species that comprised each visible community. Predation was higher on the benthos than the surface, with more total strikes and a shorter interval to predation. Only one predator species was seen during the trials, Artedius harringtoni. These results are consistent with previous studies, and support the novel combination of methods to better inform predation interactions of communities and their relative importance on each species.",,fhl_2014_Ng_34650.tei.xml

Drag forces on spines were calculated using hydrodynamic equations and compared between zoea models with long and short spines; clay models were used in corn syrup sinking rate experiments to measure drag coefficients; and zoea models were created in FreeCAD and ran through a shear simulation in MATLAB to examine their stabilities. The study found that the presence of spines increased the drag forces on the models both through calculations and through direct measurements in corn syrup. Moreover, the presence of spines made models more susceptible to tumbling under shear when the spines were flared. However, if long spines were held in typical positions, the zoea models were actually more stable than the short spined model.

This study looked at the settlement response of the competent larvae of Bugula c.f. californica when they came in contact with traces of a predatory nudibranch, Janolus fuscus, with a known positive settlement cue (biofilm), and with traces of a non-predatory nudibranch, Archidoris montereyensis. A known number of larvae were kept in small petri dishes filled with filtered seawater at about 12 degrees Celsius with no flow inside the dishes. Prior to adding the newly released larvae, the petri dishes were divided into four groups that were smeared with the three following treatments: mucus from the predatory nudibranch, mucus from the non-predatory nudibranch, and a thin layer of biofilm. Clean (un-filmed) dishes with FSW served as the control. A second study looked at preferential settlement with the known positive- biofilm, the biofilm substratum with predatory water, and ½ biofilm substratum next to ½ predatory mucus substratum. We found that the larvae in the biofilm with FSW settled early in their planktonic period. The larvae in the dishes with predator mucus, dishes with biofilm and predator water, in dishes with a choice of biofilm or predator mucus delay their settlement- perhaps in search of optimal habitats. Furthermore, when the biofilm and predator mucus exist in the same dish, the larvae preferentially settle in the side with biofilm, which suggests that they try to avoid potential predation.",,fhl_2014_Lu_34652.tei.xml

Dissections of juvenile king, adult king, and keta salmon were performed, during which measurements pertaining to the articular joint and adductor mandibulae were taken and recorded. The study found that king salmon have stronger adductor mandibulae, while keta have stronger skeletal jaw components. This trade-off is a morphological adaptation in which either force or velocity can be prioritized.

Creosote has been shown to have negative effects on the environment, and because nudibranchs’ rinophores are sensitive chemoreceptors that are used to help find food, navigate, and find mates, an interaction could be harmful to these animals. Our study looked at the preference of location in a tank with one side having creosote-treated wood and one side having non-treated wood samples. We used Triopha catalinae (Clown Dorid) and Archidoris montereyensis (Sea Lemon) as our two species. We found there was no significant preference to creosote. We also saw no preference to creosote during the day or evening, but saw a trend in T. catalinae to prefer the sides of the tank especially during the afternoon runs.

One group was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass with 1.5mm holes drilled throughout, and the other was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass without any holes. Tenacity calculations revealed that specimens were more strongly attached to the acrylic glass without holes, suggesting that suction is involved in M. farcimen attachment to substrate.

In higher flow velocities the snail body shape experienced drastically higher drag forces than the limpet and chiton body shape. The drag coefficients for the limpet and chiton both were relatively high at low flow velocity, and quickly decreased at higher speeds.

Our results demonstrated that although A. californica and T. tetraquetra lead similar lives, Armina exhibited no significant responses to magnetic stimuli, either in neurophysiological or behavioral assays.

We quantified evolutionary correlations of skeletal morphology and muscle morphology by conducting phylogenetic independent contrasts using a phylogeny constructed from published molecular data. We hypothesized that skeletal leverage (mechanical advantage) and muscle architecture (gearing) could either display a positive evolutionary correlation (changing over evolutionary time to perform inversely of each other), or the features could display a negative correlation (changing over evolutionary time to perform in the same way). We found a positive correlation between evolutionary shifts of out-lever length and adductor muscle length, but no correlation between evolutionary shifts of in-lever length and adductor muscle length or adductor muscle length and lever ratio. Our results demonstrate that skeletal leverage and muscle architecture evolve independently in individual species of sculpins.

The white button mushrooms were preferred to the other three food choices across all the different source populations. Mushrooms are typically scarce in both the Douglas-fir and grassland habitats so I found this data interesting and compared oven-dried mushrooms and reverse-osmosis water soaked lichen.

I observed the effects of temperature on feeding rates among the different source populations. Arion rufus consumed spinach leaves at the same rate across the three temperature treatments (4°C, 10°C, and 20°C); however, the large Ariolimax columbianus may be consuming the least at 10°C.

In order to precisely measure the 3-D rotations and translations of bones during suction feeding, we developed a new imaging method called Video Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (VROMM). VROMM combines bi-planar high speed video with 3-D mesh models to create highly precise animations of real-life motions. Using VROMM animations, we evaluated the opercular linkage for lower jaw depression by measuring the rotation of the lower jaw and the operculum at the quadratomandibular and operculohyomandibular joints, respectively. We filmed two species of sculpin, Leptocottus armatus and Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus, during suction feeding, and also filmed a post-mortem manipulation where we pulled straight up on the operculum to simulate the dorsal rotation described by the classic 4-bar linkage. In the manipulated trials, the measured kinetic transmission (KT) for Leptocottus and Hemilepidotus was 2.3 and 2.0 respectively. The measured KT for the live Leptocottus was 4.0, and, notably, the operculum reached maximum rotation significantly before the lower jaw.

We show that this is the case for salmon feeding mechanics of king and pink salmon. King salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eat small, fast fish; and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) primarily filter feed on planktonic organisms by keeping their mouths open while swimming. Salmon close their jaws using the adductor mandibulae, which, like all skeletal muscles, is constrained by a strict relationship between muscle length and force. Muscles that are over-stretched or overshortened exert weaker forces than they do at optimal length, and muscle length corresponds to gape. We compared the force-length curves of king and pink salmon adductor mandibulae and demonstrated that the maximum bite force of king salmon is achieved closer to maximum gape (67% of max gape, n = 3). This may allow them to take advantage of optimal muscle length, and thus greater force production, when eating large or elusive prey. In pink salmon, the force-length curve is centered at a smaller relative gape, closer to mid-gape (43% of max gape, n = 6). This may facilitate filter feeding, allowing reasonably high forces at a range of medium gape sizes. The different feeding preferences of these species may have put different pressures on the evolution of jaw muscle physiology, resulting in distinct optimal solutions to the force-length constraint.",,fhl_2015_Kaczmarek_34707.tei.xml

When the muscles contract they reduce the angle between the head and body, causing the axial skeleton to bend dorsoventrally. Without axial bending, cranial elevation would be limited and feeding performance would decrease. The goal of this study is to locate where the vertebral column bends during suction feeding and relate this to the axial morphology of different species. We collected and analyzed live feeding data from three species (largemouth bass, pacific staghorn sculpin, and striped surfperch) using 3D animation techniques. CT scans were also analyzed with a focus on the shapes and spacing of the vertebrae, neural spines, and pterygiophores. Each of the three species had unique axial skeletons comprising differently shaped and spaced vertebrae, neural spines, and pterygiophores. We hypothesized that the axis of rotation for each species is located in the anterior-most region of the vertebral column, specifically between the vertebrae with the greatest space between the neural spines and pterygiophores. Our data show that the axis of rotation is consistent for largemouth bass (joints 3 and 4) and striped surfperch (joints 2 and 3), although both species bent at different intervertebral joints. These axes of rotation for both largemouth bass and striped surfperch correspond to the organization of the neural spines and pterygiophores. The staghorn sculpin presented an interesting case where all of its axes of rotation (joints 3, 4, 5, and 6) were not associated with any unique structures. However, cranial elevation increased at the more posterior joints.

Using muscle stimulation experiments, we studied the function of the feeding apparatus muscles in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, and compared our results with muscle activity patterns recorded from previously studied Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Most of our efforts addressed function in the four major feeding apparatus muscles (the deep protractor, sphincter, perpendicular, and retractor muscles), and our stimulations of superficial musculature (superficial protractor muscles and rectus muscles) were assessed qualitatively. Stimulation experiments (tetanic contractions stimulated at 80 V, 60 Hz, 1 ms duration) were performed on in situ and excised feeding apparatuses from five animals positioned supine, while toothplate movements and muscle shape changes (strain) were analyzed from video recordings at 120 Hz. Our results confirm previous observations of M. glutinosa; in E. stoutii, the deep protractor muscles induce toothplate protraction, while activity in the retractor, sphincter, and perpendicular muscles power retraction of the toothplates. In both species, toothplate protraction causes the cylindrical feeding apparatus to decrease in length and increase in diameter, and vice versa during retraction. Upon excision from the body, the feeding apparatus in E. stoutii undergoes greater proportional length changes but smaller changes in width, suggesting that the soft tissue connections to the body wall impose constraints on muscle displacement. Because it comprises a large part of the head region (anterior 20% of total length), constraining the cylindrical shape of the feeding apparatus should work in retaining the cylindrical shape of the head while impeding unwanted head deformations in situations where the head must fit and maneuver in tight spaces (e.g. knotting and burrowing behaviors).",,fhl_2015_Fuerte-Stone_34794.tei.xml

During burial, a fish must fluidize a volume of the substrate to displace it into the water column and distribute it over the surface of the body. Thus the burial behavior forces the fish to interact with the fluid environment and a granular medium and is affected by size of the organism and grain size. We used the English Sole, Parophrys vetulus, as a model to explore the effects of scaling on burial. We recorded burial events from 15 fish across a size range (5 to 30 cm in total length), keeping sand grain size consistent, using high speed video at 250 fps and determined undulation frequency, time to burial, and percent body coverage. We found larger fishes took longer to bury and moved with a lower undulation frequency, but were able to cover themselves as effectively as smaller fish (91.6%). Undulation frequency decreased with body length to the -0.53 power; time to burial increased to the 0.67 power.

We found grain size does not affect the undulation frequency or time to burial of small fish, but as particle size increases, the percentage of the body covered decreases. It is possible that fish cannot fluidize particles of larger grain sizes as effectively as they can smaller grain sizes. Taken together, these results reveal that the timing of flatfish burial is a function of fish size and the success of the behavior is affected by the relative grain size of the sediment.",,fhl_2015_Corn_34797.tei.xml

Our goals were to describe the kinematics of the terrestrial locomotion of O. maculosus and compare their terrestrial locomotion to their aquatic locomotion, the terrestrial locomotion of subtidal sculpin species (Leptocottus armatus and Icelinus borealis), and the terrestrial locomotion of walking catfish (Clarias spp.). We used high-speed video to record locomotion on a terrestrial platforms and in water, and landmark tracking software in MATLAB to analyze their locomotion. O. maculosus use a novel form of axial-appendage-based locomotion, driven by lateral oscillations of the tail synchronized with alternating rotation about the base of their pectoral fins, described as an “army crawl”. Unlike Clarias spp., which use a diagonal gait, O. maculosus use a lateral gait. The army crawl likely originates from a modified series of aquatic fast starts in a terrestrial environment. However, they use axial undulation of the body during aquatic locomotion, whereas they use axial oscillation and pectoral fins in terrestrial locomotion. The army crawl is more effective at moving linearly on land than the terrestrial “wiggle” used by subtidal sculpins. It is possible that the earliest vertebrates on land used forms of terrestrial locomotion analogous to the terrestrial locomotion of fishes. Actinopterygians like O. maculosus may have begun the transition onto land before the rise and terrestrial success of sarcopterygians by using behavioral adaptions, which would not show in the fossil record like morphological adaptations.",,fhl_2015_Bressman_34798.tei.xml

L. vincta and L. variegata graze on macroalgae, including Ulva spp.and Saccharina sessile, as well as microalgae such as diatoms that occur on the eelgrass Zostera marina. The feeding rates of P. gracilis and Leptasterias spp. on these two species of Lacuna were determine by in lab experiments, which included no choice and preference experiments. We found that P. gracilis ate significantly more L. variegata per unit time than Leptasterias and that the two predators had the same feeding rate on L. vincta. In choice tests P. gracilis preferred L. variegata. Seastars showed no preference. Neither predator was size selective and the size of the predator did not have a meaningful impact on the number of eaten snails or the size of snails eaten. The vulnerability of Lacuna vincta and Lacuna variegata in eelgrass and macroalgae habitats in the presence of the two predators was tested through mesocosm experiments.

The resulting freshwater from this artic ice retreat enters local river systems, which flow down to the Pacific Northwest and add freshwater to the Salish Sea. With significant melting occurring in the summer months from May to June, the Salish Sea receives multiple influxes of low-salinity water every summer that can persist for a couple of days. These freshwater events can lower surface water salinity from normal 31‰ to as low as 21‰. Understanding the impact of these low-salinity events is particularly important for the larvae of seastar Pisaster ochraceus, which are limited in their ability to swim out of low-salinity surface waters. Since P. ochraceus can take over 200 days to develop and metamorphose, larvae are bound to experience at least one lowsalinity event during their development. This study looked at the effect of a constant lowsalinity environment verses a fluctuating salinity environment on P. ochraceus survival, morphology, development, and protein expression. No significant differences in survival and body size were found between treatments. However, low-salinity reared larvae had significantly shorter posterolateral arms, which has implications for feeding and swimming behaviors. Osmoregulatory and mechanosensory protein expression was upregulated in fluctuating salinity treated larvae, while low-salinity reared larvae were not significantly different from the controls. This upregulation indicates that P. ochraceus larvae are changing their protein expression in response to the lower salinity environment.",,fhl_2015_Allen_34800.tei.xml

We measured boundary layer thickness at various speeds, and characterized water flow turbulence caused by their rhinophore. This was done using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) around a fixed (dead) rhinophore on a clay model slug. We predicted with increasing flow speed, boundary layer thickness would become thinner. Results from this experiment were deemed inconclusive. We also characterized cilia-generated flow on the clavus of three species of nudibranch (Tritonia diomedea, Tritonia festiva, Armina californica). Dye flow patterns show cilia-driven currents from near the distal region of the rhinophore to the proximal region of the rhinophore. In Tritonia, the current originated at the distal tip and flowed proximal into the folds of the clavus, then spread outward towards the circumference of the base of the clavus. In Armina, the flow was unidirectionally proximal along the infolds of the rhinophore. The cilia on the rhinophore may help the animal respond faster to odor changes by removing the boundary layer (i.e. sniffing). Scanning electron micrographs showed that the tuft at the distal end of the rhinophore (a.k.a. clavus) had large patches of dense cilia on its vertical inner folds, but lacked dense cilia on the parts of clavus that are more exposed around the circumference.",,fhl_2015_Oglesby_34801.tei.xml

Our study examined the distribution patterns of the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, to determine the influence of sexual selection on the mating system. Male and female Anisolabis maritima both possess weaponry – however, females are very aggressive whereas males are tolerant of cohabitation, which led us to hypothesize that leks might be forming, or that aggressive females would maintain territories that would control the group environment. We examined single-sex and mixed-sex groups of 18 earwigs in a large enclosure throughout their active period to determine whether they were distributing themselves randomly, uniformly, or in clumps. We found that, in single-sex groups, males form clumps and females form uniform territories. Mixed-sex groups are uniform at first and become clumped, where females controlled uniformity and males changed their behavior in response to females. We also conducted a series of trials between three individuals, either single-sex groups or mixed-sex groups with two different-sized individuals of one sex and one individual of the other, to examine sexual selection and cohabitation preferences. Among single-sex groups, we found that females were unwilling to cohabitate, and small females were more likely to be excluded from shelters than large females – in single-sex male groups, however, males were willing to cohabitate, with small and medium-sized males equally likely to be excluded. Among mixed-sex groups we found a preference for smaller opposite sex partners, but the patterns suggest assortative mating.",,fhl_2015_Dodgen_34802.tei.xml

These effects of elevated CO2 on calcification have been previously shown in free-spawning larvae, but are not as well-studied in larvae that spend their early life stages in encapsulation. The focus of our study was to determine what effects CO2 would have on a diversity of encapsulated embryos, and whether different types of encapsulating structures provided different levels of protection against OA. We found only a moderate larval response to low (600 ppm), medium (1050 ppm), and high (1500 ppm) CO2 concentrations across all species taken as a whole, but did observe that several species/ populations exhibited a decline in shell length with no corresponding decline in inorganic content. This suggests that while calcification was not significantly decreased by our OA conditions, perhaps the morphology of certain shells changed, becoming wider and shorter. Our hatch times, which increased with elevated CO2, confirmed that increased CO2 placed embryos under stress during development.",,fhl_2016_Carr_37296.tei.xml

During this time, their chances of entanglement increase and so do their chances of detachment. Their blades also contain a large amount of mass, and when the current causes those blades to go in one direction, it causes tension in the stipe which in turn increases the risk of detachment. This study focuses on quantifying the location of bull kelp failure (stipe, holdfast, or substrate) throughout spring and seeing when the most breakage was observed in the San Juan Archipelago. Significant patterns in the data were variable; two locations found to have statistical significance in the average stipe length between early and late spring showed opposite trends compared to each other.

To gain insight into how group dynamics may influence the mating system, we investigated the relationship of density and morphology in the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, an insect found in high densities beneath pieces of driftwood above the high-tide line in coastal ecosystems throughout the world. There are fundamental differences in the behavior and morphology between the sexes. Males and females differ fundamentally in their aggression during agonistic encounters with conspecifics; males more readily cohabitate with conspecifics and resolve their disputes non-lethally whereas females often kill conspecifics in close proximity as they vigorously guard their offspring. Males also differ markedly from females in both body size (males are more variable in size, and sometimes substantially larger, than females) and weaponry (males possess asymmetrical, curved forceps whereas females have straight forceps). Given previously observed variation in both body size and forceps asymmetry, we investigated the possible correlation between population density and morphology of individuals in two populations on San Juan Island, WA to determine whether these parameters affect group dynamics and social interactions. Specifically, we lifted 10-15 logs at two sites (False Bay and Cattle Point) at two different times during the breeding season (June and July) and determined the overall density, average body size and average forceps asymmetry for individuals under each log. Comparing the area occupied to the body size and forceps asymmetry of individuals, we found that the relationship between body size and population density varied both by site and by the period in the breeding cycle. Additionally, we found a greater, more morphologically diverse population of males at False Bay, a site with lower tidal action and more predictable habitat availability. We posit, therefore, that the breeding cycle varies from site to site based on the stability of the environment, and that a more turbulent environment can disrupt the population and delay the breeding cycle, leading to a less diverse, more unstable population. Our results also suggest that larger individuals are more likely to live in higher densities before the breeding cycle, possibly due to their increased fighting ability and willingness to compete with others for mates, and at lower densities early in the breeding cycle due to their increased conspecific aggression during courtship and nesting. This research lays the foundation for future studies regarding the social dynamics of this species where we can monitor individual interactions and group distributions in a more controlled laboratory setting.",,fhl_2017_Coonfield_40367.tei.xml

The goal of this study is to determine whether the numerous evolutionary transitions from marine to freshwaters have altered the pattern and pace of morphological and lineage diversification within the sculpins (Cottoidea). The broad global distribution and wide-ranging ecology of sculpins make them an ideal study system in which to analyze marine invasions in northern latitudes. The sheer diversity of sculpins in isolated systems like Lake Baikal has led some to suggest these fishes (particularly Cottus) underwent an adaptive radiation upon their invasion of freshwaters in north Asia and Europe. Marine sculpins appear to be more diverse than freshwater sculpins, and while cottoids show signs of explosive radiation early in their evolutionary history, our study shows that unequal patterns of clade disparity among these lineages has led to constant rates of morphological and lineage diversification. Feeding morphology traits are highly conserved in cottoids, with both marine and freshwater species displaying similar morphologies despite widely-varying diets. While convergence in feeding morphology and dietary ecology is widespread in freshwater and marine cottoids, some specialist taxa, including planktivores and piscivores, show notable departures from the ancestral sculpin body plan. These include planktivores like Comephorus dybowskii, as well as piscivores Hemitripterus bolini and Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus.

We have investigated the interactive effects of pH and temperature on larval growth, time to metamorphic competence, and juvenile growth in the marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata. Larval growth rates and acquisition of competence for metamorphosis were measured in 4 replicate cultures in each of 4 treatment groups, representing all combinations of pH 7.6 and 8.0, at either 20° or 24°C. Higher pH and higher temperature additively increased larval growth, and larvae became competent for metamorphosis sooner at higher temperature and at higher pH, but there was no significant interaction of pH and temperature on larval growth rates or on frequencies of metamorphosis . After metamorphosis, juveniles from each larval condition were individually cultured at either pH 7.6 or 8.0. Temperature was not controlled during juvenile growth; all individuals were exposed to the same ambient laboratory temperatures of 21°-23°C. Juveniles grew at similar rates in both pH conditions. However, juveniles reared at 24° as larvae grew more slowly than their siblings that had been reared at 20° C as larvae, during the first 7 days of post-metamorphic growth. This difference was no longer apparent by 11 days after metamorphosis for juveniles derived from most larval conditions. However, slower growth persisted in juveniles that had been reared as larvae at 24° and pH 7.6, and kept at pH 7.6 after metamorphosis.

Nutrition may interact with pH to exacerbate or counterbalance acidification effects in early developmental stages. Previous work had indicated that growth of larvae and juveniles of the caenogastropod Crepidula fornicata is resilient to acidification within the pH range of 7.6-8.0 when animals are given a high-quality diet of Isochrysis galbana (ISO). We therefore reared larvae and juveniles at two levels of pH (7.6 or 8.0) and on either a diet of ISO or a poorer-quality diet of Dunaliella tertiolecta (DUN), and measured larval and juvenile growth and mortality as well as juvenile shell strength. Larvae grew about 30% faster, and juveniles grew about 50% faster, on ISO than on DUN. However, larvae and juveniles grew at similar rates at pH 7.6 and 8.0 within each diet treatment. Survivorship of both larvae and juveniles was not affected by pH, but was higher on a diet of ISO than of DUN. We thus did not find evidence for interaction of diet quality and pH in larval or juvenile growth or mortality. Juvenile shell performance was tested by measuring crushing force after 20 d of postmetamorphic growth in each combination of diet and pH. Shells were 25% weaker at pH 7.6 than at 8.0 for individuals that were fed ISO, and 55% weaker at pH 7.6 than at 8.0 for individuals that were fed DUN, even though mean shell lengths did not differ between pH levels within each diet treatment.

This is becoming an increasingly important issue as kelp productivity and population sizes have decreased over time due to an overabundance of predation and changes in the environment, resulting in kelp deforestation with decreased resilience (Steneck et al. 2002; Krumhansl and Scheibling 2012, Wernberg et al. 2019). Kelp deforestation not only posits a biological problem to its surrounding ecosystem but also an economic problem as they are an important aspect of aquaculture, are utilized in many commercial products and support many commercial fisheries by providing habitats and food web support. The increasing vulnerability of these kelp forests has become a growing problem, especially as we find out more about the vital role that kelp plays in its ecosystem. Kelp forests play in important role in fighting climate change; they sequester carbon and provide blue carbon sinks, ameliorate ocean acidification, and provide complex habitats that encourage intertidal biodiversity. This suggests that kelp aquaculture is key to fighting climate change as well (Duarte et al. 2017).They are autotrophic and are primary producers that serve as a food source, both for herbivores as live plants that are fed on as well as through the detritus that they shed (Mann 1973). They exude dissolved organic material (DOM) from their blades that contribute to both the biotic composition of their surroundings as well as to epiphyte activity (James et al. 2020). Kelp provide structural functions as well; their detritus often forms complex habitats that allow for greater biodiversity of micro-organisms that live on the ocean floor, and the kelp beds can provide a similar function as well for macro-organisms such as juvenile fish (Figure 1, Branch and Griffiths 1988). As we increasingly discover the ways in which kelp are essential contributors to its local ecosystems, it becomes more important that further studies are conducted to learn more about their rates of growth and erosion and to study which factors may affect these rates. In this study we looked specifically at Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), a brown alga that grows along the western coast of the US and is ecologically important to its surrounding habitat in the Salish Sea where this experiment took place.

Predominate cold temperate kelp species are such an impacted organism; they grow at temperature below 18°C and are now seeing a decrease in available habit as they are threatened by increasing water temperature. Nereocystis luetkeana, a kelp with a floating canopy in the sporophyte phase is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from central California to the Aleutian Islands (Druehl 1969). As in all kelp species, it has a heteromorphic life history, which leaves two phases susceptible to increasing water temperatures. In this study N. luetkeana zoospores were grown in culture to determine how the young gametophyte phase reacted to elevated temperatures. To determine the upper temperature range of gametophytes, three temperature treatments were used to cultivate N. luetkeana zoospores found in the San Juan Islands, WA. A significant decrease in the number of gametophytes and their length were observed at temperatures exceeding 15°C.

Nudibranchs, a ubiquitous group of marine organisms, are known for their beautiful colors, but not much for their developing forms. Recently metamorphized nudibranchs have fragile shells and survive in the benthos inhabiting a completely different niche than their grown forms. Doris montereyensis is a widespread dorid nudibranch species native in the Eastern Pacific from British Columbia to Baja California. Its pelagic form hatches in early summer and develops as the water warms. This study looked at how temperature variation affected the development of larval stages (shell length and cross-sectional area). Across three developmental temperatures (9, 15.5 and 20°C), shell length was not seen to increase singificantly, wherease average area was larger in colder conditions. The warmest water treatments saw death in all replicates. This may be due to experimental error or be a sign of a deeper scientific phenomenon. If temperature causes larvae to die, as sea temperature rises, this could be fatal to nudibranch populations, If, as other literature states, growth increases with slight increases in temperature, this may increase the natural range of many species, disrupting ecosystem function.

Decreasing the quantity of successful larvae, especially for keystone species such as ​Pisaster ochraceus ​(Ochre sea star)​, ​has the potential to disrupt the predator-prey balance in a variety of habitats. The sea star wasting disease that passed through the west coast of the United States in 2013 greatly impacted populations of a variety of sea stars, notably that of the Ochre sea star, and emphasized the importance of sea star presence in intertidal ecosystems. By rearing ten day old ​P. ochraceus ​larvae in three different temperatures for a week, this study examines the growth, survival, and cloning rate of Echinoderm larvae in response to elevated sea surface temperatures. Larvae residing in temperatures of 20.15°C +/- 2.65°C experienced the highest mortality rates and fastest growth, while larvae in local San Juan Island, WA, temperatures (9.13°C +/- 0.47°C) exhibited the lowest mortality rates and slowest growth. A temperature range of 15.58°C +/- 1.48°C produced intermediary growth and mortality rates, although the success of the latter is comparable to that of local temperatures. Medium temperatures induced the highest frequency of asexual reproduction. There was no difference between the cloning rate of high temperature and low temperature larval cultures.

Most studies on benthic invertebrates have focused on adult animals, but it is important to consider impacts on larvae, as they will have consequences for survival and recruitment of benthic populations. We sought to determine whether hypoxia alters the swimming behavior of Lacuna vincta larvae, and whether larvae are able to recognize and avoid hypoxic layers. We used video recording to compare larval behavior in stratified water columns with an upper layer with normoxic oxygen levels (~85% saturation, ~7.5 mg/L) and a lower layer with hypoxic oxygen levels (~13% saturation, ~1 mg/L), to behavior in similarly stratified columns where both upper and lower layers were normoxic (~85% saturation, ~7.5 mg/L). The vast majority of L. vincta larvae recorded in the videos were concentrated at the surface in our experiments. Trends among the small fraction of larvae not clustered at the top 20 mm of the columns showed: (1) slower swimming speed along the path of travel in the hypoxic lower layer than the control lower layer, (2) slower downward velocity in the hypoxic columns than the control columns, (3) faster upward velocity in the hypoxic columns than the control columns, (4) the presence of larvae on the very bottom of the control columns versus a near absence of larvae at the bottom of the hypoxic treatment columns, and (5) a slightly higher fraction of time spent in the lower layer in the control columns. The small magnitudes of these differences may be due to the small number of larvae that traveled down below the surface in the columns in all treatments, or may indicate a relatively low sensitivity to hypoxia in this species. As global climate change continues and coastal hypoxia increases in frequency and severity, it is crucial to improve our understanding of the impacts of hypoxia across ontogenetic stages of marine invertebrates, so as to understand the implications for survival, recruitment, and population resilience. Results of this study demonstrate that upswimming tendencies may reduce encounters of L.vincta larvae with hypoxia, that larvae alter swimming behaviors in response to hypoxia, and that the observed behavioral changes appear generally consistent with a weak ability to escape or avoid hypoxia layers.",,fhl_2019_Fagerström_46662.tei.xml

Competent larvae of many invertebrate species are known to respond to various settlement cues in the environment by regulating their behavior in order to facilitate settling in suitable habitats. The behavioral responses of pre-competent larvae to cues from the adult habitat could have implications for retention, however such responses have not been investigated. In this project we have studied the swimming behavior in pre-competent larvae from the gastropod Lacuna vincta in the laboratory with the objective of determining whether behavioral changes in response to potential settlement cues are present in larvae at that earlier developmental stage. Potential settlement cues included in this study are eelgrass (Zostera marina), the kelp Agarum fimbriatum, and adult L. vincta, in addition to a control of filtered seawater. Pre-competent L.vincta larvae were recorded swimming in water columns containing water in which these various cues had been soaked, and their behaviors were compared across treatments.

Colonies of Membranipora sp. were collected from two depths (0-0.5m and 1.8-2m) off of the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Islands, Washington. Stimulation of zygote release was achieved using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 0.1μM concentrations, and embryos were irradiated with UVA light from a lamp continuously for 61 hours. We measured rate of development by counting hatched blastulae at semi-regular intervals over the course of this time period. Our results show that embryos from colonies at greater depth in the ocean are more susceptible to developmental delays caused by UV radiation than those from shallower depths.

Diverse exploratory behaviors in larval Membranipora spp. Cyphonautes on suitable settlement substrates (macroalgae) have been defined (Matson et al. 2010), but little is known about the behavioral mechanisms used to find settling habitats in the first place. We investigated the behavioral swimming response to hypothesized positive and negative chemical cues in late-stage cyphonautes larvae (Membranipora spp.) to determine whether cyphonautes have noticeably different behavioral responses to chemical cue plumes. We compared the response of larvae to a control (filtered seawater) cue, a positive cue (the red alga, Mazzaella splendens), and a negative cue (predator, Corambe spp.). Larvae were collected from plankton tows and exposed to plumes of cue water for five minutes under a unidirectional, laminar flow regime. Locomotory behaviors (swimming direction relative to flow, circling behavior, crawling behavior, tank wall interactions) were recorded. The results suggest that cyphonautes larvae swim more frequently toward the source of the cue when it is a positive cue, but do not respond negatively to predator cues (from a predator of their adult form). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that competent cyphonautes larvae actively use chemosensation to locate algal blades for settlement. Additionally, the results suggest that circular swimming and swimming perpendicular to flow, in addition to swimming towards a stimulus source, might aid cyphonautes larvae in finding substrate for settlement",,fhl_2019_Benko_46666.tei.xml

Dissolved oxygen stress did not significantly affect survivorship or any of the shell metrics measured. There was considerable variation in initial shell size (maximum shell dimension) which alone could not explain variance in growth rates within and among replicates and treatments.

This study focuses on the effect of low dissolved oxygen (DO) and food stress on larval growth, lipid content, and survivorship following 6-day exposure to treatment conditions from 2 to 8 days post-fertilization. Using selected crosses between four maternal and 1 paternal lines, this study determined the effect of maternal background on larval response variables. Overall, reduced food and oxygen negatively affected growth but had no effect on lipid contents. Cohorts from different maternal lines responded differently within a DO x Food treatment combination, and highest performance did not always occur in the high DO x high food treatment. Counter intuitive differences in growth rates suggest plasticity in maternal investment or possible genetic by environment interactions. High variance in lipid content estimates existed within and among treatment combinations, and may require per larva measurements to account for inter-individual variation extrinsic to treatment level effects. Survivorship was &gt;80% overall and did not significantly differ for any maternal lines or treatment combinations. In this experiment, parental background explained 46% of the variance in larval growth, but only 2% of variance in lipid content.

1231,University of Washington,Friday Harbor Laboratories,46669,"Waite, Heidi",Preparing the next generation for climate change: parental effects on larval thermal tolerance in the Pacific blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus),2019.0,"As ocean and atmospheric temperatures increase globally, marine organisms will need to cope with or adapt to changing temperatures in order to persist. This is especially important in sessile species which cannot move to avoid stress. Parental effects, where offspring responses to environmental change are influenced by environments experienced by parents, may include mechanisms of coping with thermal stress. This study evaluated the degree to which thermal tolerance of larvae of the mussel, Mytilus trossulus, is influenced by parental environments. Adult mussels were collected from two sites of varying thermal stress on San Juan Island: Friday Harbor Laboratories dock (low stress) and False Bay (high stress). Air, water, and body temperatures were recorded in the field, and thermal tolerance (LT50) trials were conducted on adults and on their veliger larvae raised in the laboratory. Thermal tolerance was higher in adults from the high stress environment than those from the low stress site. For mussels from the FHL site, larval thermal tolerance was ~2°C higher than that of the adults. The opposite was found for mussels and their larvae from FB. Larval tolerances were higher for mussels from the low stress environment. This study concluded that thermal acclimation may have occurred in the two study populations. In addition, larvae of parents from the high-stress environment may be more susceptible to thermal stress than those from low-stress parents. Finally, larval tolerances were similar to or higher than adult thermal tolerances which suggests larvae may not be as vulnerable as suspected.",,fhl_2019_Waite_46669.tei.xml

With some elasmobranchs being seen as mesopredators, escape responses do occur within this category of animals, thereby making the kinematics of the particular escape responses important parameters to understand in terms of predator-prey interactions; an area that is missing empirical data. This study have been divided in to two parts, with Part A concentrating on the latency of escape responses of the Pacific spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi, during mechanical stimuli, and Part B containing the an analysis of how the pacific spiny dogfish react when exposed to electrical and electrochemical stimuli in the form of a by-catch reduction device (BRD) and mischmetal, respectively. Latency was found to be slower than that found for teleost species, during mechanical stimuli. As several studies has found Mauthner cells in all teleost species and connected their function to their fast latency when reacting to a potential predator threat, our results suggest that the lack of Mauthner cells in elasmobranchs is resulting in a higher latency time. The kinematics of escape responses during electrical and electrochemical stimuli showed that these types of stimuli provoked slow escape responses compared to more sudden stimuli like mechanical stimuli and attack from a predator. Additionally, the turning angles of these escape responses was found to be quite large and the response to both the BRD and the mischmetal might be categorized more as an avoidance than escape. This supports the incentive that these devices can be used in the fishery industry to reduce their bycatch of elasmobranches and increase their capture efficiency.",,fhl_2019_Becker_46670.tei.xml

Hypoxic episodes are increasing globally due to anthropogenic nutrient loading and further exacerbated by global warming. This study examines the effect of progressive hypoxia, i.e. the continuous depletion of oxygen levels, on swimming performance at optimal speed of the pile perch, Rhacochilus vacca. R. vacca is a median-paired fin swimmer that exhibits obvious gate transition from pectoral fin swimming to anaerobic burst swimming using the caudal fin.. Oxygen consumption was measured during recovery from hypoxic conditions to determine whether an oxygen debt was associated with exposure to reduced O2 levels. The optimal swimming speed was estimated to be 1.7 bls-1, using strictly pectoral fin swimming, and gate transition occurred at 2.5 ± 0.13bls-1. When exposed to progressive hypoxia at optimal speed, critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) was determined to be 10.29 ± 4.07 kPa. When approaching Pcrit, burst swimming began at 7.07 ± 0.24 kPa O2. Pectoral fin beat frequency, significantly increased at 6.3-8.4 kPa oxygen saturation. Surprisingly, swimming speed was maintained beyond Pcrit, and the average oxygen levels at which fish quit swimming was 6.24 ± 0.30 kPa. There was a significant oxygen debt measured during recovery from hypoxia, which lead to a 200% increase in metabolic rate and took approximately two hours) to return to original levels. These unexpected results suggest that R. vacca are able to maintain optimal swimming speed in hypoxic conditions by resorting to anaerobic pathways, which leads to a significant oxygen debt.",,fhl_2019_Frank_46671.tei.xml

To trigger the escape responses, we used a visual stimulation (e.g., a looming image of an approaching black circle) simulating a predator strike. For the control treatment, only a single visual stimulus was used while for the treatments we played a second stimulus, simultaneously or with a delay of 33 or 83 milliseconds. Our results revealed that a second stimulus with a delay of 33 ms affects the escape trajectory with a change of turning angle during the stage one of the escape response.

Trade-offs in swimming speed and schooling behavior among shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata) conspecifics of dissimilar size,2019.0,"In animals, group motion can be highly organized in oriented and polarized structures. In fish, such movement is referred to as schooling behavior, and while a large body of literature has focused on characterizing this behavior in relation to group size, the implications of having individuals of differences in body sizes on group cohesion and coordination are unexplored. This study focused on this knowledge gap and investigated characteristics pertaining to swimming behavior in surfperch Cymatogaster aggregata among pairs of similar and dissimilar size (i.e. groups of two big individuals, two small individuals, or one big and one small individual). We analyzed the swimming speed of both individuals, nearest neighbor distance (NND), and characterized the proportion of time spent swimming actively as a group for 9 pairs of fish. Results showed that individuals in big-big groups interact with one another almost half of the time (proportion of time spent swimming together was 48%), a high proportion relative to small-small or big-small groups (12% and 7%, respectively). Swimming speed distributions indicated that the big-big groups were the most active. The average swimming speeds were 135.5 mm/s for big-big groups (equivalent to 1.37 BL/s), 82 mm/s for small-small groups (equivalent to 1.6BL/s), and 116.3 mm/s for groups of dissimilar size (equivalent to 1,05 BL/s for the big fish and 2.32 BL/s for the small fish). Although the observed patterns will require confirmation by completing the analysis with other pairs, and by quantifying other variables linked to locomotion and trajectory, these preliminary results show that while individuals of different size classes tend to adopt group swimming for shorter time periods than when paired with individuals of a same size class, they are also able to adjust their respective swimming speeds during such periods of interaction to maintain group swimming. The existence of such tradeoffs could explain the capacity of smaller individuals to remain in shoals and schools of mixed size classes.",,fhl_2019_Mari_46673.tei.xml

Shiner perches, labriform swimmers using primarily pectoral fins and assisting with the caudal fin, were used to study the differences of fin beat frequencies and oxygen consumption between a schooling pair of fish, a solitary fish, and a false pair where a single fish swam alongside a video of a conspecific. By having a fish swimming alongside a video of a swimming fish, compared with the pair of swimming fish, the hydrodynamic effect could be separated from the behavioral/visual effect. It was found that pectoral fin beat frequencies were significantly higher for schools of two-real-fish swimming at 5.5 Bl/s relative to other groups. Additionally the relationship between oxygen consumption and swimming speed was significantly different between treatments, with the false pair treatment having lower oxygen consumption from 3.5 Bl/s and onwards. Our results suggest that the advantages of schooling are not only hydrodynamic but also behavioural, and that the relative importance of behavioural effects depends on the level of swimming activity.",,fhl_2019_Riber_46674.tei.xml

An examination of these areas proved that the mounds exhibit finer mean grain sizes, better sorting, more organic material, and greater abundance and diversity of meiofauna in comparison to the troughs. It is believed that the abundance of meiofauna, especially nematodes and harpacticoid copepods, can be related to the sediment sorting at the various stations. Mound sites are better sorted as they are in lower energy hydrodynamic regimes and are colonized by tube-building polychaetes (Diopatra sp.), which act to stabilize the sediment.

1291,Carleton College,Wrigley Marine Science Center,,"Shaughnessy, Ann; Downie, Alan A.",Copper concentrations in selected marine molluscs,1983.0,Selected molluscs from Hopkins Marine Station and the Monterey Municipal Wharf were analyzed for copper concentration in soft parts. Atomic absorption analysis indicated higher levels of copper in animals from the Wharf area than in those from HMS. Magnification of copper concentration through trophic levels was not observed in organisms selected.,,
1292,Carleton College,Wrigley Marine Science Center,,"Smith, David R.; Wright, Todd W.",Oxygen evolution/consumption and phototaxis in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima,1983.0,"Oxygen evolution/consumption and phototaxis in the clonal form of Anthopleura elegantissima, a sea anemone with symbiotic zooxanthellae, was investigated in order to draw comparisons between its phototaxic behavior and oxygen physiology. Anemones purged of their symbionts and placed into 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 115 ml of sea water demonstrated a marked decrease in the oxygen concentration of their surrounding sea water regardless of their periods of exposure to light. Anemones with symbionts, when placed in a lighted environment, showed an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration above that of their initial value. However, when placed in the dark, there was a substantial decrease in dissolved oxygen levels. Such findings would suggest that anemones with symbionts, when placed in an oxygen poor environment, would seek light so that the zooxanthellae could produce needed oxygen. Nevertheless, when anemones were placed in the dark halves of three different tanks (one oxygen-rich, one normal sea water, and one oxygen-poor), none showed a movement into the lighted halves of the tanks. A negative or neutral phototaxic response was observed, not the expected positive response. Thus it would appear that oxygen can not be implicated as a controlling factor in photosynthesis.",,
1293,Carleton College,Wrigley Marine Science Center,,"Springer, Scott R.","Prey size selection by the predatory gastropod, Acanthina punctulata",1983.0,"Optimal foraging theory predicts that for a predator limited to one prey there should be a prey size which maximizes the energy gained by consumption per unit foraging time. Observations were made of the predation of the intertidal gastropod, Acanthina punctulata, on populations of Littorina planaxis with a controlled distribution of size. Although size selection appeared to occur, it could not be compared with the theoretical predictions because of insufficient data. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the selection observed was due to physical limitations on the relationship between predator and prey sizes rather than energy maximization.",,
1294,Carleton College,Wrigley Marine Science Center,,"Vincent, Alexandra",Demonstration of aggregation in Olivella biplicata,1983.0,Clumping behavior of Olivella biplicata in a large outdoor tank was examined using a statistical test for a Poisson distribution. Clumping was observed in five of the six experiments. The effects of plant and animal material in the tank on horizontal distribution were examined. Avoidance and escape responses of the live snail to several of its gastropod and asteroid predators were studied.,,

Even so the general overall scheme of nitrogen and phosphorous involvement is still somewhat up in the air. Many theories and isolated experiments have been reported but it is only recently that some of the basic facts have been agreed upon in general. This paper will attempt to show a simplified scheme of the importance, utilization, and regenerative processes involving nitrogen and phosphorous.",,

The promotor-remotor muscular system was traced from the point of origin at the junction of the arthrodial membrane and the coxa to the insertions on the endophragmal skeleton. The origin of the depressor and levator muscles at the basis-ischium segment of the endopod of thepereiopods was also observed. The dissections were guided by the literature currently available on a related genus Jasus. Some dissimilarities are pointed out between these two genera.,,
