Adams, 1854), was studied. the intestinal sites of hydrolysis of certain carbohydrates and the location of production of their respective enzymes were studied. The presence of an amylase, laminarase, alginase, fucoidase, and cellobiase was demonstrated. The major tissue sources of the above enzymes were: buccal cavity, stomach, digestive gland, spiral caecum, thin and thick hindgut for amylase; buccal cavity and esophagus for laminarase and alginase; buccal, eshoagus, stomach and digestive gland for fucoidase; salivary glands, spiral caecum, thin and thick hindgut for cellobiase. Some of the carbohydrate hydrolysis appears to be due to bacterial action. Intracellular digestion of starch in the wall of the hindgut is indicated.","1":"1. Tegula funebrals will ingest nearly any alga growing in or out of the littoral zone. Both macroscopic and encrusting forms constitute important food sources; the granite surfaces contain a negligible amount of organic detritus and contribute little to the diet of the animal. Earlier work on T. funebralis and observations of T. gallina show that the animals will ingest organic detritus when it is available. 2. The snail prefers a \"fleshy\" alga among macroscopic forms (e.g. Macrocystis integrifolia, Nereocystis luetkeana, and Gigartina canaliculata). 3. Feeding rates per gram are greater in the smaller animals and apparently not affected by lack of sunlight. 4. A short field suggests the importance of the feeding activities of Tegula funebralis on the local algal crops.","2":"The digestive tract of a gastropod was examined to determine type, location, and density of micro-organisms. Digestive contents were examined microscopically and streaked on to media. The center of density was the stomach, spiral caecum, and digestive gland area, where abundant yeast cells were seen and numerous rod-shaped bacteria cultured. Cocci were seen most abundantly throughout, although rarely cultured. Spiral organisms, thought to be two spirochaetes and a spirillum, were found in the stomach and described. The pH of the gut varied from 6.5 to 7.5.","3":"1) Of the three species of hermit crabs found in the intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, Pagurus samuelis is the only one encountered at positions higher than about 1.2 m, P. hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus being found lower. 2) Of the three species, Pagurus samuelis appears to be able to survive exposure out of water better than the other two. Adults of P. hirsutiusculus are least able to withstand exposure to air in sunlight. 3) The three species make use of various shells to different degrees. 89% of the Pagurus granosimanus and 75.9% of the P. samuelis collected occupy Tegula funebralis shells, whereas, the smaller P. hirsutiusculus tended to occupy shells of smaller snails such as Epitonium, Mitrella, Homolapoma, etc. to a greater degree. 4) The bigger Pagurid individuals are largely dependent on Tegula funebralis for homes whereas the smaller sized hermit crabs are not, and occupy a variety of small shells. 5) Both Pagurus samuelis and P. hirusutiusculus attain sexual maturity at a relatively small size and thus are not completely dependent on Tegula funebralis for the survival and reproduction of the species. However, when larger shells are not available, the reproduction potential in P. samuelis may be greatly reduced since the smaller individuals produce far fewer eggs than the larger ones.","4":"Tegula funebralis has both gustatory and olfactory sense sites. The side of the foot, the head tentacles, and the epipodial structures serve as contact chemoreceptive sites. Extirpation or scraping of these structures does not alter the overall sensitivity to Pisaster ochraceus. Scraping the bottom of the foot, cutting the border between the side and bottom of the foot, removal of the epipodial fringe (on the left side of the foot), removal of up to half of the ctenidium do not noticeably alter chemoreception. The osphradium functions as an olfactory organ and is capable of detecting the presence of an extract containing 2.6 X 10^-5 parts by weight of tube feet from Pisaster ochraceus. The osphradium, when stimulated, seems to cause the animals to be more sensitive to stimulations of the head tentacles and epipodial structures. Removal of part of the osphradium does not result in appreciable change of chemoreceptive abilities of T. funebralis.","5":"Acmaea asmi is distributed in the rocky intertidal at Mussel Point between the vertical height of 0-6 feet (with maximum density from 2-4 feet and from 0-52 meters from the higher high water mark. The animal lives on the shell of Tegula funebralis and seems to be attracted not only by microscopic algae as a food source, but also by some property of living T. funebralis. Experiments were carried out to determine preference of A. asmi for various shell substrates, in addition to investigating the transfer rate. The respiration of the algal crop of T. funebralis and of A. asmi was measured to find an index of feeding rate.","6":"Three proteolytic enzymes were found in the digestive tract of T. funebralis, which had pH optima of 5.0, 8.6 and 10.5. The enzyme extract was a saline homogenate of the entire digestive tract, which had been centrifuged, filtered, and then filtered through a Sephadex G-50 column. The substrate used was sodium caseinate. Activators included Mn++, and cysteine: inhibitors included Co++, Zn++, and Hg++.","7":"Oxygen consumptions were determined with the Winkler method. The Barker and Summerson method was used for lactic acid determinations. The oxygen consumption by Tegula funebralis continues in water of low oxygen content, but at a much reduced rate. Lactic acid does not accumulate in excessive amounts until the animal has been under conditions of low oxygen tension for periods in excess of 160 hours. It appears that both cessation of physical activity and a continued low extraction of oxygen from the environment tend to suppress the accumulation of lactic acid when the animal is in waters of low oxygen content.","8":"The activity pattern of the black turban snail Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854) at Pacific Grove, California is the subject of this article. Field studies were carried out to follow the locomotory and feeding activities, to determine how much of each animal's time was spent in each of these activities, and when and under what environmental conditions they occurred.","9":"The activity pattern of the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis (A. Adams, 1854) at Pacific Grove, California, is the subject of this article. Field studies were carried out to follow the locomotory and feeding activities of individuals of T. funebralis, to determine how much of each animal's time was spent in each of these activities, and when and under what environmental conditions they occurred.","10":"Tegula funebralis is negatively phototactic. It becomes adapted to bright light, and loses its sensitivity temporarily. It has a general body sensitivity shown by a shadow reaction. Its eyes, simple lens ocelli, seem responsible for directional orientation to light. Without eyes its orientation is irregular.","11":"Tegula funebralis displays a characteristic \"rise behavior,\" probably in response to gravity. The functional value of this is uncertain, but may be correlated with exposure to air; although such exposure is not necessary, it seems to be \"preferred.\" T. funebralis is perhaps in the process of evolving into a land snail. The animals inhabit zones (MLLW) high enough to be exposed to the air at least once per day; the universality of the tides would explain the remarkable constancy of the lower limit.","12":"1) Test were performed on the snails, Tegula funebralis and T. brunnea, to determine the nature and quantity of their excretory products and the organs of excretion. 2) Standard colorimetric assays were used on homogenates prepared from the ctenidium, digestive gland, right and left kidneys. Total non-protein nitrogen, ammonia, urea, and uric acid were determined. 3) Uric acid was observed to be the major excretory product of these snails. It accounted for 11.8% to 76.6% of the total non-protein nitrogen in the right kidneys, the only organ where this waste product was detectable. Only slight traces of ammonia were found in the digestive gland, and no urea was present in the tissues tested.","13":"In spite of the abundance of Tegula funebralis (A. Adams 1854) in the California intertidal, no account of its anatomy has yet appeared in the literature, although the anatomy of other trochids has been described (Randles, 1905; Fretter and Graham, 1962). To partially fill this void, a brief account of certain external and internal features of T. funebralis is herein presented.","14":"Unknown green pigments from Tegula funebralis and the similar green pigments from Tegula brunnea, Tegula montereyi, Tegula pulligo, the red and black abalone (Haliotis) were studied. The configurations of all the spectra of these various pigments are similar: however, the absorption peaks vary within a range of 40 mu in the visible and 2 to 10 mu for the UV peaks. It would seem that perhaps the compounds are members of the same family. This assumption is further supported by identical solubilities and behavior toward hydrogen ion concentration.","15":"1) Hemocyanins from Tegula funebralis and T. brunnea were compared with respect to oxygen equilibration. 2) Only slight differences between the hemocyanins for the two species were detected in the oxygen dissociation curves. 3) P50 values for T. funebralis and T. brunnea were determined to be 45 and 55 mm Hg respectively. 4) For the pH used, prosthetic group interaction appeared to vary depending on the oxygen partial pressure. 5) A method for purificaiton of hemocyanin was developed using Sephadx G-200. 6) It appears that no smaller molecular weight proteins or polypeptides are present in these sera. 7) The absorption spectrum for T. funebralis blood gives the major peak at 371 mu and the minor peak at 560 mu.","16":"Tegula funebralis is activated when subjected to current and\/or air turbulence; this behavior agrees with Cloudsley-Thompson's remark (1961, p. 45) that many seashore animals are activated by waves. Further, current causes Tegula to orient into the flow, and also keeps them down near the bottom; if the current is sufficiently strong, however, they will often turn and head for shelter at the first respite. Preliminary tests in a vertical tube (250 cm\/min flow) indicate that snails tend to go down regardless of current direction: evidently current stimulation, and not direction, causes Tegula to go down. It was shown that Tegula changed their orientation to current after a few hours: this may be a set pattern of response, or perhaps the snails became fatigued. Gradation of current needs to be tried in all these cases. Finally, there is a definite response to air jets: the snails would clump in regions of greatest turbulence. This turbulence seemed to enhance the effect of light (the snails going down in light, up in dark). It is possible, however, that these results were due to the entering air rather than to the turbulence: further tests are definitely necessary.","17":"1. Shell is erosion is caused by the activities of several animals (bryozoans and polychaetes), by mechanical wear, and by a fungus, which was cultured on agar plates. 2. Normal shell growth, recorded over a period of 15 days in 28 animals, was intermittent, but averaged 6 microns per day added to the outer lip of the aperture. 3. Repairs to shells damaged mechanically, by filling the aperture, grinding holes in the body and upper whorls, and by cracking in a vise are described.","18":"Crepidula adunca is a protandric marine prosobranch commonly found on the shells of Tegula funebralis. Female C. adunca are oriented in a consistent manner on the whorls of the T. funebralis shell. There is no free swimming larval stage; the brooded young crawl or are pushed out from under the mother as juveniles similar in form to the adults. The newly hatched spat are very motile; the great majority drop off the host and sink. Weak water currents stimulate the spat; there is net orientation into current, against gravity, and toward moderate light. Spat are only weakly attracted to either T. funebralis or older C. adunca; this attraction is clearly present in older individuals.","19":"The animals tested were allowed to respire in sealed flasks and water samples were withdrawn every two hours and examined for oxygen content by the Winkler method. Snails from China Point (Monterey Peninsula, California) have a lowered oxygen consumption at sunset and high high tide, and an increased oxygen consumption at sunrise and low low tide. The snails may build up an oxygen debt during high high tide, which is repaid during exposure to air at low low tide. Lactic acid content of snails at high high tide was about twice as great as that of snails at low low tide.","20":"An attempt was made to determine the growth rates of A. asmi and of T. funebralis. Caged populations were maintained in a natural environment for nine months and all animals were individually marked and measured, using a series of techniques, every two weeks. No growth was noted.","21":"We investigated Tegula funebralis' intertidal distribution and movement patterns in relation to certain biological and physical environmental factors. Before investigating movement patterns, we wanted an accurate, correlatable distribution analysis for several areas along Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. To do this, we collected information pertaining to numbers and size classes of the snail along with environmental data of the areas, such as vertical level of collection, algal covering, area configuration, substratum, and wave and current action. Factors that seem to affect the distribution were then checked by exposing marked populations to these various conditions and observing the movements of the snails.","22":"1. Eggs and sperm are shed into the water, and spawning seems to be stimulated by exposure to light following darkness. 2. The larvae develop rapidly; torsion begins between 30 and 35 hours and is completed by 55-60 hours. 3. A. asmi larvae appear to be attracted to T. funebralis at 6-7 days and probably settle about this time.","23":"The reactions of Tegula funebralis were tested to a number of starfishes and carnivorous snails. The responses vary according to the type of animal used as a source of the stimulus. Tegula flees from the contact or presence of predatory starfishes, ignores non-predaceous ones, and attempts to escape from or crawl upon the shell of the carnivorous snails used in these tests. Strong escape responses were elicited on contact with predatory starfishes such as Pisaster ochraceus, P. brevispinus, P. giganteus, Pychnopodia helianthoides, Leptasterias aequalis, and the carnivorous snails Thais emarginata and Acanthina spirata, but not the non-predatory sea stars Patiria miniata and Dermasterias imbricata. Escape reactions are also elicited by substances diffusing from the five predaceous sea stars listed above. No similar response is caused by the other test animals.","24":"It is assumed that all Littorina planaxis eventually die; and that there is a steady turnover of individuals in the population. The most obvious possible causes of accidental death are being torn from the rocks and tumbled into the sea, and being eaten by possible predators as gulls, plovers, crabs, starfish and squirrels, though these animals were never seen ransacking the L. planaxis colonies. Since the actual causes of death in the L. planaxis are not obvious, it was necessary to devise field studies and laboratory experiments, which would bring out as many of these subtle fatal conditions as possible. The following paper deals first with the structure of the population as a whole; the second and third sections deal with the two large causes of attrition: wave shock and predation.","25":"1. Littorina planaxis show a correlation between size and rate of water loss, the large animals losing more slowly than the small ones. 2. Decreasing surface\/volume ration with increasing size probably explains this finding. 3. Clustered snails desiccate at a slower rate than single individuals attached by mucus, which in turn desiccate more slowly than those with no mucus attachment, in a desiccator, in the laboratory and under natural conditions. 4. The tolerance for desiccation was found to be quite high. Snails desiccated in a natural environment lost approximately 70% of their total water and survived.","26":"1. These was found the be variation in the total non-protein nitrogen (NPN) as well as constituent products in the kidney of Littorina planaxis. 2. Snails from low in the intertidal contained more NPN, ammonia, and urea than those in the high regions. 3. Snails in the low area contained very little NPN and ammonia at LLW. 4. Urea was found in smaller quantities than ammonia in snails from both regions; in both areas, however, the average amount of ureas increased form the first tidal cycle observation to the second, carried out two and one-half weeks later. 5. There was less undetermined-N in the kidneys of low area snails than high. These averages decreased over a period of two and one-half weeks. 6. Uric adic-N was negligible until the second tidal cycle observations, where it then constituted up to 20.7% NPN in the kidneys of higher snails and 3.13% NPN in those lower. This production was very spasmodic with rapid elimination.","27":"In summary, Littorina planaxis generally eats only microscopic foods and those macroscopic algae small enough to be consumed entire or nearly so. The reasons for this are not clear, but may be related to the structure of the mouth, or the preference for certain types of substrates. Littorina scutulata is frequently found eating macroscopic algae, especially Cladophora, Pelvetia, and other more easily ingested forms. The effects of this feeding are probably important in limiting the spread of new plants, and the effects on established thalli, while possibly considerable in some instances, appear to vary greatly with the species of algae.","28":"Littorina planxis crawling on glass plates in the sunlight orient themselves primarily along the sun's rays. A response to the plane of polarization of the sunlight is the probably mechanism involved. L. planaxis behaves photo kinetically, increasing both its rate of turning and tis rate of forward crawling at higher light intensities. The littorine eye, as tested by the tentacle jerk response, is sensitive on the light in the middle of the visible spectrum. Snails found on dry rocks were always photonegative. In either case, the response is strengthened by 24 hours of constant light or darkness.","29":"1. Enzyme extract of the esophagus and midgut of Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata were found to contain amylases capable of splitting starch and glycogen. Only one strain of bacteria isolated from these organs could digest starch. 3. Alpha glucosidase activity was detected on maltose and sucrose. The alpha 1,3 glucose galactose linkage in turnaose was split by the esophagus of both species. 3. Esophagus extracts showed galactosidase activity on agar and melibiose. 4. No cellulose digesting bacteria were detected. However, cellulase activity was found in the midgut extracts and cellobiase activity in both tissues of both species.","30":"1. The following algae were identified in the habitat of Littorina planaxis and L. scutulata (* denotes positive identification as food): Chlorophyta - (*)Spongomorpha coalita, (*)Entocladia testarums (on shells), (*) Unicellular greens; Cyanophyta - (*)Plectonema terebrans, (*)Calothrix pilosa, (*) Calothrix crustacea, Dermocarpa sp., Spirulina sp., (*)Unicellular blue-greens; Rhodophyta - (*)Rhodochorton rothii; (*)Diatoms. 2. The standing crop of the microscopic algae on granite surfaces is 37gs carbon\/m^2 with a production rate of 1.66 gs carbon\/m^2\/day. Production rate for the algae on the shells of L. planaxis is .981 gs carbon\/m^2\/day. The pigment content of the algae on the shells is much greater than that of a rock or Ulva surface of similar size. 3. In 25 days, ten snails reduce the algae pigment content of a 225 cm^2 granite surface by approximately 8% when compared with an ungrazed surface of similar size.","31":"The habitat of the grey periwinkle, Littorina planaxis Philippi (1847), well above high water on rocky western North American shores, exposes this snail to desiccating sun and wind and high temperatures to a greater degree than most other intertidal organisms (Ricketts and Calvin, 1952). This degree of exposure presents several problems to the process of reproduction. Fertilization is internal, which requires that males must have some means of locating females, recognizing them as such, and mating with them. This paper will attempt to explore the mating behavior of Littorina planaxis and explain its method of locating other individuals, differences in the behavior of males and females, and the anatomy and mechanics of copulation.","32":"Heretofore, observations on the spawning and development of the internally fertilizing intertidal snails, L. planaxis and L. scutulata have been limited to studies conducted by Hewatt(1938) and by Glynn (1963). Recent observations at Hopkins Marine Station on the central California coast further elucidate the reproductive biology of these littorines. These studies, conducted in the laboratory and in the field in the period April 21 to May 29, 1964, shed some light on spawning behavior and suggest relationships between development and ecological conditions pertaining to these two species.","33":"The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the geotatic responses of Littorina planaxis and to explain these responses in terms of adaptive significance. The study was begun with field observations of the Littorines at the Hopkins Marine Station, where the high intertidal habitat of the snails is divided into adjacent horizontal and vertical planes by granite boulders and promontories. The Littorines are distributed on both the primarily horizontal surfaces (O to 15 degrees in this study) and the primarily vertical surfaces (70 to nearly 90 degrees in this study). In the field studies, snails on vertical surfaces were found to exhibit an apparent geotaxic response, moving up or down the rock surface, depending on the condition of the light and the tidal height. Snails from horizontal surfaces, of course, cannot show the same type of behavior, nor is it called for during their daily behavior.","34":"Littorina planaxis and LIttorina scutulata are sea creatures adapted to the ecological habitat \"uppermost rocky beach.\" Their prime problem is prevention of desiccation. Therefore their activity is correlated with moisture such that under dry conditions they will be protected by the closed operculum. Factor equaling or associated with activity (foot attachment, motion, pairing) all showed an increase with an increase in moisture. Clustering, an inactive state, showed an inverse relationship with moisture; from this data it is hypothesized to function as a protection against desiccation. Temperature, as measured, was decided to be a meaningless parameter. No evidence was found for either tidal or circadian rhythms. Wind was considered to act indirectly by decreasing moisture. Thus an inverse effect with foot attachment and pairing and a direct effect with clustering were observed. An interesting and consistent difference was shown by the two species, L. scutulata tended to be less active, to require more moisture before showing activity, and to demonstrate a higher percentage of clustering.","35":"The populations of the two species of prosobranch mollusc Littorina common to the central California coast, Littorina planaxis (Phillippi, 1879) and LIttorina scutulata (Gould, 1849), overlap in the intertidal zone; however, the species L. planaxis is usually found inhabiting the higher regions of the intertidal while L. scutulata generally inhabits the lower. Their very distribution suggests a possible difference in respiratory rate between the two species and between individual of the same species.","36":"High density groups of Littorina planaxis found in cracks, concavities and around protruding quartz crystals were found to be of fluctuating numbers and constantly changing membership. Persistence of clusters in cracks was found to be greater than in the slighter irregularities, largely due to their greater size. No relation could be found between cluster sizes and any environmental variable, but the percentage of population clustered was found to be inversely proportional to the wetness of the rock. Increases in percentage clustered was most noted at dawn, and the maximum percentage clustered was recorded during the daylight hours on dry rock. Snails were found to be trapped by shade on drying rock, but they ignore the difference in light intensity when the rock is wet. Mucus trails are hypothesized to be a means of directing snail traffic to the cluster-prone areas. Application of heat was found to increase percent-age of snails clustered. Possible adaptive advantages: better chance of surviving desiccation, mechanical protection from waves.","37":"1. An account is given of the experiments designed to elucidate the sources and modes of formation of the excreted urea, uric acid, and ammonia in the marine gastropod Littorina planaxis. 2. It is suggested that arginase is not concerned with the production of ureas in the members of this species because no correlation was found between the amount of urea and arginase activity. In the production of ureas and ammonia, which represent the principal nitrogenous end products of the Littorines, the enzyme arginase is not of significant importance. 3. Xanthine ocidase is shown to present in the kidney of this snail, though hitherto, it has not been found in other marine invertebrates (Baldwim and Needham, 1934). It is suggested that this enzyme maybe responsible for formation of uric acid in Littorina planaxis and other members of this group, whether the uric acid is derived ultimately from nucleic acid breakdown or from protein deamination. 4. The uricotelic character of the metabolism of this gastropod is supported by the presence of urease, uricase, and xanthine oxidase in the kidney tissue and indicate a mechanism, which can account for most of the nitrogen excretory products.","38":"Questions to be handled in Paper: 1. Establishment of a basici positive rheotaxis in L. planaxis. 2. Effects of starvation on the taxis. 3. Possible sex difference in activity and its reversal during spring.","39":"This paper describes an in vitro analysis and partial characterization of the proteolytic enzymes of the digestive gland of Littorina planaxis, a prosobranch mollusc. The few studies which have been conducted on the digestive enzymes of marine gastropods have revealed no proteinases in the salivary glands of the herbivorous prosobranchs (Freter and Graham, 1962). These organs appear to function principally in secreting mucus, which facilitates the passage of ingested food from the buccal cavity to the stomach. There is also unanimity in the conclusion that no digestive enzymes are secreted, or any food absorbed, in the intestine (Freter and Graham, 1962). The present studies have been confined to the digestive gland, although the esophagus also merits study.","40":"1. The cephalic tentacles, of Littorina planaxis, are not critical to general movement, but are used, while the snail moves, for tactile surveillance, and they enable the animal to perform more easily such maneuvers as righting. 2. Removal of the tentacles does not impair the ability to detect diffusible substances from the predacious snail A. spirata or from female L. planaxis. 3. The tentacles appear necessary for sex recognition on contact. 4. The tentacles are employed in following mucus trails on the substrate. The trails of other L. planaxis are followed more consistently than are trails laid down by other species of molluscs.","41":"Thus, the physical force of water and the biological force of predation combine to set a lower limit on the habitation of LIttorina. This limit facilitates their survival and functions through a mechanism of negative geotaxis. It is possible that ling ago, the ancestors of these Littorina developed in two directions. One branch had a negative geotaxis and climbed out of the water. The other branch may have had a positive geotaxis or none. Those Littorina living below the water were eventually eaten by crabs, starfish, and fish while those above the sea have survived.","42":"The predacious Muricid whelk, Acanthina spirata, secretes a substance which diffuses from its pedal mucus and to which Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata respond by accelerated motion and an increased tendency to leave the water. Homogenates of the foot of A. spirata have been prepared capable of eliciting a similar response, and the active substance in the homogenates show to be dialyzable and ether extractable from acidified solutions. Both L. planaxis and L. scutulata show a similar response to the Muricid whelk Thais emarginata.","43":"Crepidula perforans (Valenciennes, 1846), a gastropod living inside hermit crab shells, is unevenly distributed in the area of China Point at Hopkins Marine Station. The mollusc is not found in shells less than 0.25 inches in diameter. It is most often, though not always, found in Tegula funebralis shells. The distribution of the mollusc in different species of Pagurus is varied. The animal is situated in the outermost whorl of the shell with its head facing the opening. The larger the crab, the more C. perforans it is likely to have. The larger the Crepidula inhabiting the shell, the fewer found in the shell. The young molluscs are able to cling to the shell upon hatching. C. perforans is attracted to Pagurus but not to members of its own species or T. funebralis shells. The mollusc is able to move from one hermit crab to another.","44":"Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanus show a rhythmic activity pattern in which most crabs are active at night while the number active during the day is greatly reduced. This pattern of dispersion appears to be an inverse response to intensity of illumination. Pagurus samuelis consistently becomes active earlier in the afternoon than does Pagurus granosimanus.","45":"Data are presented on the rate of locomotion of Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis at different times of the day and night. There appears to be general tendency for these crabs to slow down at night, but there is an unusual increase in the speed with which the crabs move at 2200. More experiments under controlled conditions are needed.","46":"A survey of the intertidal and subtidal areas off Mussel Point has shown: (1) the Pagurus spp. found intertidally occupy definite horizontal and vertical zones. The inner section of the transect contains primarily P. samuelis, the middle section P. granosimanus, and the outer regions P. hemphillii, with P. hirsutiusculus extending over most of the transect. (2) Juveniles of P. granosimanus are not clustered together in large quantities under rocks and algal cover, whereas the other three species of Pagurus exhibit high population densities under these conditions. (3) The data on population in figure 4 suggests the following hypothesis -- any sample with a population density greater than 100 per 0.1 meter squared will tend to be composed predominantly of one species. (4) Pagurus spp. may be located in terms of a preferred environment P. samuelis can be found in rocky exposed areas, where P. hirsutiusculus prefers regions with algal cover. P. granosimanus is found in the pools and mild surge channels of the middle and lower intertidal, where P. hemphillii prefers the deeper waters and constant surge of the lower intertidal and subtidal regions. (5) The number of Pagurus spp. is reduced in the subtidal region. P. hemphillii is the dominant species, P. granosimanus is found occasionally, with P. samuelis and P. hirsutiusculus absent entirely in the small region studied here.","47":"1. While ammonia was found to be the principal nitrogenous excretory product of Pagurus samuelis and P. granosimanus, substantial amounts of urea, allantoic acid, and allantoin were also detected. Small amounts of uric are also excreted. 2. Individual crabs showed considerable variation in the amounts of the various nitrogenous compounds excreted. 3. No difference in excretory products was observed between the species tested.","48":"Optimum pH, temperature and substrate concentration were determined for the hepatopancreatic lipase present in Pagurus granosimanus. 1) The pH optimum was 7.2. 2) An optimal temperature of approximately 35 degrees Celsius was demonstrated. 3) Highest activity was reached at a substrate concentration of 0.432 grams Tween per ml. of lipase extracted from 0.05 g tissue.","49":"1) Pagurus hemphilli, P. hirsutiusculus, P. granosimanus, P. (setosus) and P. (californiensis) were found inhabiting the subtidal region. 2) Paguristes bakeri and P. turgidus were found in the subtidal region. 3) Large numbers of pagurid glaucothoe were found residing in shells. 4) Coralline algae is the substrate having the highest population density of pagurids.","50":"1) Under lab conditions hermit crabs were preyed upon by Cancer antennarius, C. productus, C. gracilis, Pycnopodia helianthoides, Pisaster ochraceous, and Octopus apollyon. In the field Pisaster ochraceous and Evasterias trochelii were found preying on Pagurus. 2) Cancer antennarius in the lab was observed to have a specific behavior for capturing and retaining Pagurus. After which the shell was examined and later cracked by varied techniques using both of the crab\u2019s pincers. Once the Pagurus was exposed from the cracked shell the maxillapeds helped extract the hermit crab and push it towards the mouth. 3) Pisaster ochraceous and oftentimes Pycnopodia helianthoides when unable to extract the Pagurus whole will insert their stomach into the shell and digest the Pagurus. 4) Pagurus in lab tanks reacted to the mere presence of a moving Pycnopodia helianthoides and showed and escape response to the Pisaster ochraceous after capture.","51":"Preliminary work using a homogenate of hepatopancrease from Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859) appeared to show the presence of the enzymes capable of degrading purines. This work was undertaken to confirm these observations and to detect the enzymes present in the following hypothetical sequence: xanthine --(xanthine oxidase)--> uric acid --(uricase)--> allantoin --(allantoinase)--> allantoic acid --(allantoicase)--> urea --(urease)--> ammonia. Included in this is as search for enzymes that would allow the introduction into the sequence of adenine and guanine.","52":"1. Tests were performed on P. samuelis and P. granosimanus to determine the effects of temperature and desiccation. 2. P. samuelis can tolerate higher water temperature than P. granosimanus with P. samuelis lethal temperature at 31.5 degrees C and P. granosimanus 29.7. 3. Shell temperature measurements on exposure to sunlight showed that P. samuelis maintained a lower shell temperature longer and possessed an apparent behavioral response for controlling temperature. 4. Both species die at 45-65 minutes out of the shell when exposed to the sun with P. samuelis body temperature at death higher than P. granosimanus. 5. When exposed within the shell P. samuelis lived longer and had a lower body temperature at death then P. granosimanus. 6. P. samuelis loses more water and faster than P. granosimanus both in and out of the shell. 7. Generally P. samuelis is adapted to a higher position in the intertidal zone due to its ability to withstand and control temperature.","53":"1. Under the conditions of the experiment, enzyme extracts, prepared from the hepatopancreas, foregut, and midgut of P. samuelis were found to show no activity capable of hydrolyzing the following carbohydrates: laminarin, fucoidin, cellulose, cellobiose, sucrose, agar, and alginate. 2. Alpha glucosidase activity was detected using maltose in extracts of hepatopancreas and foregut, the former producing a higher reaction rate. Both extracts reacted more rapidly at a pH of 5.7 than at a pH of 7.5. Midgut extracts indicated no hydrolysis of the 1,4 alpha glucose linkage. 3. No chitinase activity was observed in any of the sections of the gut studied. 4. Extracts of the anterior midgut diverticula showed no increase in reducing sugar over controls when tested for maltase activity.","54":"1. The size distributions of gravid females in the intertidal region for the two species are almost identical, but P. granosimanus carries about twice as many eggs as P. samuelis. 2. For an animal of a given size, there is a large variation in the number of eggs carried. 3. Gravid P. granosimanus smaller than any in the intertidal region are found in the subtidal region. 4. P. granosimanus eggs increase more rapidly in weight than do P. samuelis eggs. 5. P. samuelis increase slightly more rapidly in size, because they become more elongated.","55":"1. The glycogen levels for the hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle of Pagurus samuelis are between 0.32% and 6.7% and between 0.064% and 0.58% of dry weight, respectively. 2. During starvation the mean percent glycogen by dry weight decreases from 2.4% to 1.3% in the hepatopancreas and increases from 0.2% to 1.2% in the abdominal muscle. 3. The presence of UDPG epimerase or similar mechanism for the conversion of D-galactose into D-glucose is suggested.","56":"1. An attempt was made to establish active immunity in Pagurus granosimanus to an homogenate of the sea anemone, A. elegantissima, with no success. 2. Keeping P. granosimanus in close contact with A. elegantissima did not increase its resistance to anemone homogenate.","57":"The larvae and young adults of Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson, 1857), Pagurus hirsutiusculus (Dana, 1857), Pagurus granosimanus (Stimpson, 1859), and Pagurus hemphillii (Benedict, 1851) were comparative studied to discover characters by which these species could be readily distinguished without the use of a high magnification microscope. P. samuelis and P. hirsutuisculus, P. granosimanus and P. hemphillii, and P. ochotensis could easily be separated into the above groups but further identification proved difficult in the young adults and sometimes impossible in the larvae.","58":"Factors influencing the mortality rate in laboratory population of Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson) were examined. Among factors shown to be important are those involving space, availability of shells, and behavioral interactions. Factors negligible to the mortality rates of these studies were starvation and time.","59":"A behavioral study of functions of the first and second antennae of Pagurus granosimanus and Pagurus samuelis was made. The primary method was extirpation and comparison with intact crabs. No chemotaxis or left-right preference was observed. Rheotaxis was found to occur in both species, but antennular involvement was only evident in Pagurus samuelis.","60":"1. The hepatopancreas was found to be the most important producer of amylase in Pagurus samuelis. 2. The foregut, though much weaker, was also shown to have significant amylase activity. 3. The other portions of the digestive system had activities equal to or lower than muscle tissue. This activity is probably the result of amylase in the hemolymph and blood. 4. Under laboratory condition the pH optimum was found to be 7.0. 5. Under the same conditions, the temperature optimum was found to be near 35 degrees Celsius. 6. Some evidence for the possible presence of a B-amylase was found.","61":"The behavioral basis of the association between Acmaea asmi and Tegula funebralis has been investigated. The observations indicate that A. asmi is not attracted by a diffusible substance, but senses its substrate through contact with its tentacles. The critical substance(s) on the shell are easily destroyed or dissolved by ethanol and slightly removed by distilled water. These factors are also present on Pagurus inhabited Tegula shells, but are not found on uninhabited shells found on the beach.","62":"Respiration in two species of limpets, Acmaea digitalis Eschsholz, 1833 and Acmaea scabra (Gould, 1848), was studied by means of Warburg manometers. In both species it was found that the maximum respiration rate occurs when the animal is submerged, and least occurs when it is exposed to air. Under damp and aerial conditions A. scabra showed a much lower rate of respiration than did A. digitalis. Under conditions of increasing temperature from 10 to 25 degrees C, A. scabra increased its respiratory rate approximately 60%. A. digitalis' rate increased 23% from 10 to 20 degrees C, but at 25 its rate had decreased to less that that at 10.","63":"Nitrogen excretory products were examined in the genus Acmaea by a microdiffusion technique for urea and ammonia and a colorimetric technique for uric acid. Five species were examined, varying in vertical distribution. Similar concentrations of ammonia, urea, and uric acid were found in all five species. A large amount of intraspecific variation in the distribution of these compounds was noted, especially in the high intertidal form Acmaea scabra and Acmaea digitalis. These variations might reflect individual differences in enzyme activity, individual differences in diet, or adaptive responses to the environment.","64":"The carbohydrate digestion of four limpets, Acmaea scabra, A. digitalis, A. limatula, and A. scutum was studied. The presence of a kappa-carrageeninase, an agarase, a laminarinase, a fucoidinase, an alginase, and an amylase was found in all species. Some correlation of available sources of food with enzyme activity was found. Carbohydrase levels in starved animals were compared with level in non-starved animals. A decrease in enzyme activity during starvation was found, and the amount of this decrease could be correlated with height in the intertidal, higher species (A. scabra and A. digitalis) showing less decrease than lower species (A. limatula and A. scabra). This correlation might be related to food retention time and to feeding behavior.","65":"Examination of naturally damaged shells of Acmaea scabra, A. digitalis, A. pelta, A. scutum, and A. limatula showed that damage to the margin due to chipping predominated, but shells were found with regions near the apex crushed, with severe erosion by a fungus, with cracks extending from the edge to near the apex, with the tops eroded apparently by barnacles, and with small holes of unknown origin near the apex. A scutum was the species most commonly damaged. Repair was always accomplished by the secretion of new nacreous layers below the damaged portion. Rates of repair of artificially damaged shell margins exceed rates of growth where the margin remains intact.","66":"Predation on Acmaea populations by various predators including the crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, was studied. Laboratory observations and experiments indicate that the crab can remove the peak of an Acmaea shell by applying pressure with the cheliped on a fracture zone encircling the shell above the muscle scar. The results of a survey of Amaea shell cast up on the beach at Pacific Grove, California, and the number of limpets dispatched by the crabs in the laboratory indicate that Pachygrapsus crassipes is responsible for significant mortality in limpet populations.","67":"Most movement and feeding occurs when individuals are submerged at high tide or splashed at receding tides. At night populations show a net displacement upward on vertical rocks when the tide rises and a net displacement downward as the tide recedes. Feeding is not continuous during periods of submersion and splash, and individuals do not feed every high tide. A. pelta ingests a variety of blue-green, green, red, and brown algae, both macroscopic and microscopic and diatoms. The most common macroscopic algae eaten are: Rhodoglossum affine, Endocladia muricata, Iridaea sp., Pelvetia fastigiata, and Egregia menziesii. In habitats where A. pelta occurs with A. limatula, the former eats mainly larger, erect algae, the latter mainly encrusting and microscopic algae.","68":"Acmaea limatula moves only when splashed or submerged, whether this period comes during the day or night. Movement commences shortly after wetting, rises to a high level as the tide comes in, drops during periods of high tide, and increases again as the tide recedes. At night rising tides produce upward movement, but during the day the animals move downward on both rising and falling tides, particularly during the latter. Some homing occurs, particularly on horizontal surfaces. Acmaea limatula spends most of its time on the red encrusting algae Hildenbrandia and Peyssonelia when these are available. The main foods of the limpet are microscopic algae and the encrusting red and coralline algae Hildenbrandia, and Peyssonelia Lithothamnion and Lithophyllum. Non-encrusting forms are not eaten unless they are short, growing close to the rock surface. Dietary studies suggest that in habitats where both A. limatula and A. pelta occur, there is little competition for food.","69":"The lethal temperatures of two species of limpets, which occupy the same intertidal levels, were studied. It was found that A. scabra (with a critical range of 40-44 degrees Celsius) is better able to withstand high temperatures than is A. digitalis (with a critical range of 39-42C). Concurrent field studies showed that A. scabra experiences higher microhabitat and body temperatures than does A. digitalis at similar air temperatures. It was found that the limpets' body temperatures were 2-6 C higher than surrounding external temperatures. Intraspecific differences in temperature tolerance were also found, with the highest intertidal members of each species surviving better than the lowest members. Possible causes of intraspecific differences are acclimation or size of the animal.","70":"Homing behavior of A. scabra (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) from rocky shores was studied in field and laboratory. Populations residing 7.1 and 2.4 feet above MLLW showed no significant differences in homing ability. All size classed about 5-6 mm. in shell length showed equal homing abilities; smaller animals often did not exhibit homing. Scrubbing the substratum with a fiber brush, or treatment with 32% NaOH had no significant effect on homing tendency. Chiseling of the rock surface caused a drop in incidence of homing. This suggests that homing behavior is mediated through perception of the topography of the substratum, and is not a chemotactic response. Removal of the cephalic tentacles reduced the tendency to home, while removal of the eyes did not.","71":"Populations of Acmaea pelta (Eschscholtz, 1833) on the Monterey Peninsula, California exhibit variation in shell shape and color. Field studies showed possible correlations of these variables with algal association, substrate, and exposure. Shell shape seems to be dependent upon substrate and exposure. Shell color may be related to diet, but preliminary investigations of gut carbohydrases failed to reveal any distinctive quantitative differences in the amylase, fucoidinase, and alginase activities found in the A. pelta forms assayed.","72":"Immature individuals of the amphipod Hyale grandicornis were found under the limpets Acmaea scabra, A. scutum, A. digitalis, A. limatula, and A. pelta on intertidal rocks 1-6 feet above mean lower low water along the California coast. H. grandicornis was not found in other situations in the adjacent habitat. During the day, the amphipods lie deep in the mantle groove or nuchal cavity; at night they move to the rim or upper surface of the shell and apparently feed on algae growing on the shell. The percentage of Acmaea hosting immature H. grandicornis increases with decreasing height in the intertidal region. Hyale exhibits no definite preference for a particular species of Acmaea.","73":"Colloidial carbon injection showed that blood flow is close to the external surfaces in the ctenidium and the mantle facing the mantle groove, and that blood flows through one or the other of these areas just before returning to the heart. A ciliary counter-current was also found associated with each of these surfaces. Field observations showed the mantle vessel network expands and ctenidium withdraws when out of the water. The low intertidal species Acmaea scutum, A. pelta, and A. limatula have larger ctenidia and smaller mantle expansion capabilities than the high intertidal species A. digitalis and A. scabra. Micro-oxygen electrode measurements indicate that both the mantle and the ctenidium are respiratory surfaces, and that the mantle is more effective in aerial conditions and the ctenidium in submerged conditions.","74":"Acmaea digitalis populations often cluster on intertidal rocks at low tide. Clustering occurs in areas which receive some shade and some protection from direct wave action. Animals disperse on a rising tide. Reclustering occurs during tidal ebb while rocks are still wet, and takes place both day and night. A cluster varying in size from 22 to 44 individuals occupied an average of 15 square inches (range 8-20 in^2) each day over a 32 day period. Daily shifts in cluster position occurred; total cumulative area occupied by the cluster in 32 days was 77 square inches. Only 17 members of the original cluster remained after 32 days, while a total of 22 new members entered.","75":"Acmaea digitalis, at low tide, on dry vertical intertidal rocks tend to orient with the head pointed downward and to the right (facing toward 3 to 6 o'clock). When splashed by rising tide, they turn either right or left, and move about; no marked orientation tendency appears. On receding tides activity decreases and limpets again come to rest and tend to orient toward 3 to 6 o'clock. Changes in orientation reflect changes in direction of movement. Percent of animals moving, and average distance moved increase with increasing duration of the period of wetting. The population shows a net movement upward during higher high water periods, or during storms, and downward during lower high water periods; this tendency is more marked for high tides occurring in daylight than at night. Some animals display homing behavior.","76":"Activity of embryonic carbohydrases, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase were analyzed fluormetrically in the unfertilized eggs, trochophores, and veligers of the limpet Acmaea scutum. Glucose-6-phosphate and isocitrate dehydrogenase activity were constant at all stages. Hexokinase activity increased almost three-fold between the trochophore and veliger stage. No maltase, galactosidase, or amylase activity was found at any stage. A laminarinase-type enzyme, capable of degrading algal laminarin to free glucose, was found in all embryonic stages. This enzyme may be involved in digestion of laminarin when the embryo becomes a feeding larvae, or may be involved in intracellular breakdown of beta, 1-3 linked glycoproteins during embryogenesis.","77":"Acmaea scutum moves most when subject to the turbulence of the tidal wash during tidal ebb and flow, but continues to move when submerged at high water. A. scutum moves upward with the incoming was during tidal flow and downward with the outgoing wash during tidal ebb. The movements of A. scutum during periods of wash appear to be dependent on the light conditions; vertical and total movements are greater at night than during the day. In the laboratory A. scutum moves upward when submerged; the rate is slowest when animals are illuminated from above, higher under conditions of darkness, and still higher when the animals are illuminated from below.","78":"Light responses in six species of the genus Acmaea (Acmaea scabra, A. digitalis, A. scutum, A. pelta, A. asmi, and A. limatula) were investigated. Acmaea limatula showed the strongest responses to light. All responses exhibited were negative phototaxes. Experiments varying color and intensity indicate the eye spots of A. limatula are important as photoreceptors in colors blue, green, and red at high and low intensities. There is at least one other photoreceptor and pigment, which is functional only in blue light at higher intensities. Other observations showed no correlations between size and response to light.","79":"Placement and extent of the radula sac, the form of the jaw, the arrangement of the salivary glands, the looping of the gut, and the interconnections of coelomic derivatives are described and illustrated for Acmaea asmi, A. digitalis, A. limatula, A. pelta, A. scutum, A. scabra. The ratio of radula length\/shell length is nearly 2 in A. scutum and 1-1.5 in other Acmaea species. Jaws vary in shape; the hard anterior band in A. pelta, A. incessa, and Lottia gigantea bears an anterior median tooth. Salivary glands vary between species in length of ducts, size and position of glands. The pattern of gut loops shows minor but consistent differences between Acmaea species. Development of the adult pattern of loops is essentially completed before animals reach a shell length of 4mm. The gut tends to be thicker and heavier in species feeding on larger erect or encrusting algae (A. pelta, A. limatula, A. scutum) than in species feeding on films of microscopic algae (A. digitalis, A. scabra, A. asmi). Limpets from the high intertidal zone (A. digitalis and A. scabra) have relatively larger right and left kidneys than do Acmaea species from lower levels.","80":"Populations of the limpet Acmaea scabra found high in the intertidal remain immotile and do not feed for long periods of time, while lower populations move and feed more frequently. Studies were carried out to determine whether any nutritional or metabolic adaptations enable these high populations to sustain themselves over these prolonged periods between feeding. Comparisons were made of glycogen content and respiratory rate between two populations; one at +2 feet in the intertidal, the other at +6 feet. It was demonstrated that the higher populations have greater glycogen stores and lower respiratory than the lower populations. The differences could represent an adaptation to survive for long periods between feeding.","81":"1. The mantle cavity temperature of Balanus glandula closely follows its shell surface temperature. 2. Adults can withstand from 0% to 300% sea water; they exclude the lower salinities by closing the opercular plates, effectively sealing themselves off from the surrounding water. 3. Embryos can tolerate from 50% to 200% sea water. 4. Salinity does not appear to be a limiting factor in the distribution of Balanus glandula.","82":"Separated by paper chromatography, eight amino acid were identified in the mantle cavity fluid of Balanus glandula. They are glutamic acid, lysine, proline, alanine, valine, serine, leucine, and arginine. These amino acid do not compare identically with those found in the blood of the same organism, one main difference being the presence of hydroxyproline and traces of proline in the blood, and the absence of hydroxyproline and large concentrations of proline in the mantle cavity fluid. Reasons from the presence of amino acids in the mantle cavity are discussed.","83":"1) The rates of activity of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucoisomerase, and fructose diphosphate aldolase are compared at four developmental stages of the barnacle Pollicipes polymerus. 2) All enzymes except phosphoglucoisomerase exhibited major activity between the blastula stage and the naupliar rudiment stage. 3) The ratio of fructose diphosphate aldolase to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was lowest at the early stages, and highest at hatching. 4) Indication is given that the pentose shunt may play a major role in glucose degradation during barnacle embryogenesis.","84":"1. The clotting mechanism of Balanus nubilus was found to be affected by calcium ion with a threshold value for induced clot formation of blood, diluted 1:3:1 with 10%EDTA and 3% NaCl respectively, falling between 0.025M and 0.1M calcium chloride. 2. The clotting mechanism of B. nubilus was also found to be affected by hydrogen ion concentration with an optimum value for clot formation at a pH value of approximately 6.7.","85":"1) Four digestive carbohydrases, laminarinase, maltase, chitinase, and amylase have been demonstrated in Balanus nubilis (Darwin, 1854). 2) The tissues showing highest enzyme activity were as follows: laminarinase, last half of the midgut; maltase, foregut; amylase, glandule pancreaticae; and chitinase, foremost part of the midgut.","86":"1) Six carotenoid pigments, -carotene, isozeaxanthin (?), lutein, zeaxanthin, an astaxanthin ester, and astaxanthin were isolated from the bodies and stalk fluid of Pollicipes polymerus, although the proportions differ in each case. 2) Similar extracts of the different developmental stages of ovigerous lamellae showed the presence of the same six carotenoids with the exception of isozeaxanthin. 3) A decline of the amount of astaxanthin ester and luetin and the apparent simultaneous increase of astaxanthin with maturation of the nauplii was observed. 4) Astaxanthin was found to be bound to a lipo-protein in the stalk fluid and ovigerous lamellae but not in the bodies. 5) The presence of protein-bound astaxanthin in the lamellae appears to decline with maturation. 6) The involvement of astaxanthin lipo-protein complex which is stored in the stalk fluid is discussed .","87":"Experiments were done with Chthamalus dalli to determine what factors affect the rate of both in vivo and in vitro hatching of nauplii. Aside from mechanical fragmentation of the lamellae, which increases the rate of hatching, no physical or chemical factors were found to affect the rate. From the field work done, there is no evidence to suggest that a factor regulating the hatching is necessary.","88":"The present study developed out of a need to identify young post-settlement specimens of four species of Balanus found on 8 X 10 inch wooden plates used for fouling studies by Dr. E.C. Haderlie of the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Barnacle cyprids as well as larvae of other organisms settled on these plates; mortality of juveniles was sometimes high and many were killed before they had developed to a stage where they were easily identifiable on the basis of adult characters. For population studies it was desirable to find simple characters by which juveniles could be diagnosed.","89":"Studies on the nitrogenous excretory products of Balanus nubilus indicate that the barnacle excretes a large part of the total nitrogen in the form of a uric acid-like material.","90":"1) On electrophoretic separation, a total of 5 protein bands were detected in the Balanus nubilis blood. 2) Three of the proteins present in B. nubilis blood showed peroxidase activity. Because of tests performed on the fastest of these proteins and absorption spectra obtained for the whole blood, this fast protein is assumed to be hemoglobin. 3) Molluscan hemocyanins migrate much slower than Crustacean hemocyanins and, in some species, split up into electrophoretic \"fast\" and \"slow\" components. [note: original text obscured at this point] ...respiratory pigments consistently showed strong peroxidase activity.","91":"Embryos of Balanus glandula will concentrate amino acid from an external source and incorporate it into protein. Moreover, the pattern of incorporation varies between different embryonic stages. It has been found that the lowest incorporation occurs at the early stages and the highest during the middle stages of development.","92":"1) It was found that Balanus glandula and Chthamalus dalli ingested four unicellular green algae (Platymonas sp., Stichococcus sp., Chlorella sp., and Dunaliella viridis) and two diatoms (Nitzschia closterium and N. closterium minutissima). 2) Nauplii of both barnacle species survived longest on Platymonas. 3) Greatest growth and development for both naupliar species was provided by a Platymonas diet. Chlorella and Stichococcus do not promote larval growth.","93":"Study of RNA synthesis in embryonic and developing barnacle nauplii of the species Pollicipes polymerus was undertaken. The technique employed was radioactive labelling with C14-uridine on barnacle stages ranging from cleavage to the second molt after hatching.","94":"1) A comparative study of desiccation in three species of Balanus from different intertidal zones was undertaken. 2) It was found that the high intertidal B. glandula is adapted to desiccation by being able to tolerate large body water losses. Though B. glandula normally respires aerobically, it can revert to partial glycolysis under conditions of extreme stress. 3) The lower intertidal species B. nubilis and B. tintinnabulum were found not to possess any special adaptive mechanism that would enable them to cope with extreme desiccation.","95":"B. glandula and P. polymerus were raised in vitro from hatching to the fourth instar nauplius and C. dalli from hatching to settlement of the cypris. B. tintinnabulum was raised through stage III. Cultures were maintained at room temperature and fed on a diet of Platymonas sp.. Larval size, shape, and details of the tail and appendages are presented for all species and all stages observed. Definite differences between instars, and between species at the same instar, permit identification of species and stage of development. Setation formulae, particularly of the antennule, though of limited value for distinguishing different species, proved good indicators of specific instars. Body shape and tail morphology provide the most useful characteristics for species recognition.","96":"This study describes the feeding responses of Balanus glandula, with particular reference to food particle characteristics which evoke those responses as follows: 1) Captorial feeding is induced by tactile stimulation. This stimulation is provided by any particle within a size range of approximately 20mu to 400mu. 2) An endogenous regulation of captorial feeding maintained feeding activity in those barnacles which have recently fed. 3) no selection of particles corresponding to nutritive values occurs during filtration or ingestion. 4) These conclusions are discussed in relation to the gut contents of barnacles recently collected in the intertidal.","97":"1) Second stage Pollicipes polymerus (Sowerby) and second and third stage Balanus glandula (Darwin) tend to be negatively phototactic at higher temperatures and positively phototactic at lower temperatures. 2) The effect of temperature on naupliar behavior is never absolute. Nauplii appeared capable of adaption to both increased temperature and increased light intensity. 3) Second stage P. polymerus nauplii were found to be negatively geotactic in complete darkness. This upward migration could be stopped by warm water thermoclines of both 9 to 18 degrees C and 12 to 16 C. 4) Negative phototaxis elicited by a beam of 3000 foot-candles could be stopped by cold waters of 7 to 7.2 C. 5) An apparent interaction of negative phototaxis and positive geotaxis seems to account for the downward migration of Pollicipes nauplii. 6) The possibility that early stages of Pollicipes and Balanus nauplii exhibit diurnal migration in the field is discussed.","98":"1) The gross and microscopic morphology of the peritrophic membrane of Balanus nubilis, B. tintinnabulum, Tetraclita squamosa are described. 2) The cells of the membrane are characterized with vital staining. 3) The composition of the peritrophic membrane is described qualitatively. 4) The peritrophic membrane is shown to contain a rather broad compliment of enzymatic activity.","99":"The present study is concerned with describing copulatory activity and the reproductive states of the participants in Balanus glandula, Darwin, 1854 and Balanus tintinnabulum (Linnaeus, 1758), and investigating the maximum reach of the penis and possibility of self-fertilization in B. glandula and Chthamalus dalli Pilsbry, 1919.","100":"1) Balanus glandula produces some feces throughout the tidal cycle except for an eight hour period following termination of feeding at high tide. 2) Submersion increases defecation, and complete emptying of the gut occurs only when animals are at least awash. 3) When kept dry, B. glandula will exhibit almost complete emptying of the gut within 24 hours after the end of the last feeding. 4) The beginning of defecatory activity, approximately eight hours after the end of last feeding, coincides with the onset of lower high water. On some days the barnacles do become awash at lower high water, and experimental submersion of B. glandula at this time can stimulate defecation. This suggests that at least a portion of digestion has been completed by this time, and therefore the filling and emptying of the gut may occur on either a 24 hour or a 12 hour cycle with reasonable efficiency.","101":"The vascular anatomy of the Annelid worms has, in general, been little studied. This is especially true of the marine worms of the family Cirratulidae in the class Polychaeta. The vascular organization, blood flow pattern, and blood vessel structure were examined in detail for the species Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore, 1904).","102":"Habituation in marine worms is well documented. Sedentaria or tubiculous worms have been shown to habituate to tactile stimuli, varying light intensities, and mechanical shock (Nicol, 1950). The withdrawal reflex of Cirriformia spirabrancha to mechanical vibration has been successfully habituated. Retention of the habituation was shown to be present 1 hour after initial habituation. When tested 6 hours after initial habituation there was no noticeable retention of the initial habituation. There is a great deal of variation among individuals in the rate of habituation to vibrational stimuli.","103":"1) Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore, 1904) maintains its coelomic fluid slightly hyperosmotic to the blood over the range of salinities tested. 2) The salinity tolerance limits of C. spirabrancha as determined by the LD50 values are 23% and 220% sea water. These limits were slightly reduced for worms placed in the external medium without substrate. 3) Volume changes for animals in various concentrations of sea water and sucrose indicate that this polychaete reaches equilibrium to hyperosmotic media by a means not totally dependent upon water loss. This property may account for the observed tolerance to high salinities.","104":"1) The blood of Cirriformia spirabrancha showed only one band upon electrophoresis suggesting the presence of only one blood protein. 2) The pigment absorbed at 573 mu, 537 mu, and 400-415 mu in the oxygenated form and at 550 mu and 400-415 mu in the reduced form, the characteristic spectra of oxyhemoglobin and hemoglobin respectively. 3) The molecular weight was estimated at 190,000-200,000. Evidence of fragmentation of the molecule suggest that the weight of 200,000 represents some subunit of a larger molecule. 4) An oxygen-dissociation curve was constructed indicating that the pigment unloads at extremely low tensions of oxygen.","105":"The cirratulid polychaete, Cirriformia spirabrancha, was found to tolerate anaerobiosis up to 48 hours. However, the biological advantage for the organism of anaerobiosis is approximately 24 hours. Longer regimes leave the animal moribund and subject to environmental activities such as wave action which would disintegrate the worm before recovery from anoxia. The length of the tentacles and body increases as oxygen tension is lowered, but once anaerobic conditions are reached the tentacles contract and coil tightly, while the body remains elongate. Cyanide, for reasons still unknown, is fatal within 20 hours. Whether carbohydrates, which comprise 0.97% of the dry body weight, are utilized during anaerobiosis is still unknown.","106":"1. The nephridia of Cirriformia spirobrancha have been described to be a pair of sac-like organs with a large blood supply and extensive internal surface area located in the first two-postprostomial segments. 2. The presumed gonoducts have been described to be simple tubules located in the genital region. 3. Possible functions for both nephridia and gonoducts have been postulated.","107":"1. the respiration rate of Cirriformia spirabrancha (Moore, 1904) is dependent on size and temperature. 2. C. spirabrancha acclimates at 21 degrees Celsius, but respiration rate becomes depressed at 7 C. 3. In a sealed chamber, the respiration rate decreases and then increases to initial value as the oxygen tension decreases from 100% to 0%. This indicates the possibility that C. spirabrancha can regulated its oxygen consumption. 4. The three techniques (Warburg, O2 analyser, Winkler) used to measure respiration rate yielded slightly different results, perhaps due to the excited state of the worm during the experiments. 5. An activity pattern was observed, but its cycle was not determined.","108":"1. Movement of Cirriformia is random and not extensive. 2. Cirriformia appear to move diagonally, and possibly horizontally. 3. The number of tentacles observed on the surface of the substrate in a given population seems to represent only 35-55% of the total population during night and ay, and during all phases of the tidal cycle except in dry sand during an extremely low tide when their tentacles are retracted. 4. Evidence indicates Cirriformia remain n the upper 8 inches of the substrate.","109":"Studies were made on amino acid uptake into alcohol soluble and alcohol-insoluble products by the polychaete, Cirriformia spirabrancha. A radioactive tracer method was used employing glycine-UL-C14. The uptake versus wet weight relationship was linear, and can be expressed as Uptake = kW. The body wall and tentacles were the major areas of uptake, with the tentacles having a rate five times as great as the body on a weight basis. Uptake versus external concentration was also studied. The Vmax was 2.4 X 10 ^(-6) M\/g per hour and the Km was 1.2 X 10^(-4) M\/L.","110":"1. C. spirabrancha primarily excretes ammonia, along with trace amounts of urea and taurine. No amino acids were found to be excreted. 2. Studies of uricase, allantoinase, allantoicase, and urease suggest that the ammonia primarily results from a uricolytic pathway. 3. The presence of ornithine transcarbamylase, argininoguccinate lyase, arginase and citruline in the tissues strongly suggest a functional ornithine-urea cycle. 4. Glutamine-like labile amides present in the greatest amounts in the tissues associated with excretion support the idea that amino acid deamination may also play a role in the formation of ammonia. 5. The rate of ammonia excretion in this sedentary polychaete is relatively constant. 6. The ammonia content of aqueous gut contents is very low, which suggests that there is no enteronephric excretion. 7. The most probable sites of excretion are the tentacles and, to a lesser extent, the anterior body wall, which contains a single pair of large nephridia. This hypothesis is supported by biochemical assays done on the tissues, by behavioral studies, and by descriptive anatomy of the nephridia. 8. Following inanition, the levels of ammonia and urea drop markedly in the tissues associated with excretion and maintain their levels in the tissues associated with the bulk of the catabolic machinery.","111":"1. Laminarin, starch, and cellulose are found to be degraded by extracts of the gut of Cirriformia spirabrancha. 2. The stomach and fore-intestine of the annelid are identified as the probable sites of enzyme action. 3. Differentiation of the abilities of C. spirabrancha to synthesize carbohydrases was attempted without definitive results.","112":"The lack of predation on C. spirabrancha seems to be due mainly to a compound found within the body tissue, which has thus far been identified only as a primary amine. This compound seems to make C. spirabrancha unpalatable to other animals.","113":"The effects of water height, temperature, and light intensity on the movements of the marine annelid Cirriformia spiribrancha were investigated. Of these three environmental factors, only changes in water height elicited movement in C. spirabrancha in that the worms only reacted to an absence of water on their tentacles and body.","114":"Populations of Cirriformia spirabrancha from Monterey, California are infected in high frequency with a coelomic gregarine and at least on intestinal sporozoan. This communication describes some aspects of the parasites of C. spirabrancha. Various stages of the life cycle of the coelomic type are demonstrated, and the trophic form of the enteric type is introduced. Preliminary investigations into the mechanism of infection are noted.","115":"The cirratulid polychaete Cirriformia spirabrancha living in intertidal regions which are rich in organic detritus has been studied. Results from the studies on the feeding of this worm indicate that C. spirabrancha is a selective feeder on organic detritus, especially from algae that is in the surface layers. Mucus production and probable tentacle activity seem important in food collection.","116":"1. Respiratory rate of Cirriformia exhibits both short and long-term fluctuations. 2. The patterns of different \"groups\" of worms being tested at the same time are often significantly synchronous. 3. These patterns are not consistently sychronous with either tidal or diurnal cycles. 4. Possible reasons for these patterns are discussed.","117":"1. Three types of body wall preparations of Cirriformia spirabrancha were tested for spontaneous activity and thresholds, these being (10 body wall with ventral nerve cord and head intact (2) body wall with ventral nerve cord only (3) body wall without lateral nerves. 2. All three types of body wall preparations reach differently to changes in salinity and calium ion concentrations. 3. all three types of boyd wall preparations are more sensitive to low salinities than to high salinities. 4. Two types of spontaneous activity were found; one controlled by the head and one by the nerve cord. 5. The nervous system is divided into two opposing systems, on inhibiting and one exciting muscular activity. 6. The head region may be important for (1) controlling one type of periodic rhythm (2) inhibiting muscular activity (3) regulating ion concentrations.","118":"1. The distribution of Cirriformia spirabrancha with respect to various environmental factors was studied in detail at Elkhorn Slough, Monterey Bay, California. 2. Winter storms and strong wave action are not primary factors in limiting the distribution of C. spirabrancha at Elkhorn Slough as they are for C. tentaculata at Hamble, England. 3. Salinity, pH, and temperature do not seem to appreciably affect the distribution of C. spirabrancha at Elkhorn Slough.","119":"1. A simple new microphotmetric method was developed for studying the rate of tetrazolium reduction in single oocytes. 2. When corrections were made for the different optical path lengths of these eggs, the results showed that the tetrazolium reduction by the activity of G-6-P dehydrogenase and duccinic dehydrogenase were very nearly constant in all stages. Constant enzyme activity in different stages of development implies constant synthesis of G-6-P deyhydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase over the course of oogenesis. 3. Future application of this method may be very helpful in studying enzyme activity under a variety of conditions, especially form material not available in large amounts.","120":"Cirriformia spirabrancha, a marine polychaete, was proven to exist in aggregated densities in two field study areas located in Monterey Bay, California. The data was gathered by taking cores of the substrate and counting the C. spirabrancha in each sample; this method also proved valuable in determining the density and geographical description of various aggregates. Many environmental factors were eliminated as effectors of aggregation since they were not able to vary significantly in the short distances involved between populations of very high densities (70\/80 cm^2) and populations of very low densities. Other environmental variables that could vary with small changes in distances, organic content and particle size, were proven to have no correlation with variations of the worm's population density.","121":"1) Regeneration of the tip of the prostomium, the tentacles, and the pygidium occurs in C. spirabrancha. 2) Regeneration of caudal segments may occur, but at a rate too slow to be observed during the available time period. Regeneration of the supraesophogeal ganglion may also occur. 3) There appears to be, in general, greater capacity for wound healing and faster pygidial regeneration in smaller animals than in larger animals. 4) The presence of an axial gradient of regenerative ability in small animals, and certain areas of increased wound healing ability and regenerative ability in larger worms is indicated by results of several experiments. 5) The conditions under which these experiments were conducted were probably not best suited for survival and regeneration of C. spirabrancha. Contradictory results were sometimes obtained from duplicate experiments. Therefore, the results of these experiments cannot be regarded as conclusive proof of the conclusions drawn from them, although further experimentation may reveal the causes of the discrepancies.","122":"DDT inhibits photosynthesis in natural populations of marine phytoplankton at levels as low as 10ppb, and reduces it to 5% of the normal rate at 1ppm. The rate of photosynthesis\/unit chlorophyll A decreased with increasing concentration of DDT, with a corresponding increase in the rate of respiration. In exponentially growing cultures, the rate of chlorophyll A synthesis decreases with increasing concentration of DDT. DDE, the most common analog of DDT in the environment, inhibits photosynthesis at much lower concentrations, and to a greater extent, than DDT.","123":"There has been little work done on the entrance of DDT into the marine food web at lower trophic levels. The herbivorous marine planktonic copepod Calanus helgolandicus was incubated in seawater which contained C14-DDT or phytoplankton labeled with C14-DDT. Uptake of C14-DDT directly from the water was about 10,000 times the initial concentration in 24 hours. The copepods took up more of the C14-DDT when it was present in phytoplankton.","124":"Previous studies of enzymatic degradation of DDT generally have been limited to species showing evidence of the development of resistance to prolonged exposure to high levels of DDT. In this study we attempted to determine whether similar mechanisms of enzymatic degradation of DDT also exist in three marine invertebrates. Under the conditions of these experiments, Pisaster ochraceous, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and Mytilus californianus show no evidence of enzymatic degradation of DDT to DDE or DDD. This observation implies that the DDE and DDD residues found in these species by Risebrough are the result of direct uptake of these DDT derivatives from the marine environment.","125":"1. In natural populations Mytilus californianus of lengths 1, 3, and 5 cm have been found to have concentrations of DDE of 120, 96, and 62 ppb, respectively, per wet weight of body tissues. 2. Mussels can take up substantial amounts of DDT directly from the surrounding seawater. 3. Over a 12 hour period mussels 1 cm in length take up five times as much C14-DDT directly from the seawater as animals 5cm in length. 4. The uptake of C14-DDT from phytoplankton by the smaller mussels is 4-4.5 times greater than the uptake by the larger animals over the same time period. 5. The amount of water filtered by a mussel decreases with age and may account for the more rapid uptake of DDT by younger organisms. 6. The ability of younger mussels to adjust to experimental conditions more readily than older ones may also partially explain the differential uptake rates. 7. It is suggested that if Mytilus is typical of marine organisms in its ability to concentrate DDT directly from the surrounding seawater, than the marine pesticide pollution problem may be greater than originally thought.","126":"The investigation reported in this paper represent the results of both a survey of natural DDE levels in six commercially important organisms and a more detailed study of the relation between pesticide levels and age and weight in one of these fishes, the bocaccio. Results indicated that the concentrations of DDE were generally larger in animals feeding on higher trophic levels, and that within a given species (Sebastodes paucispinis) the amount of pesticide could be positively correlated to both age and weight.","127":"The aims of this study were twofold: 1) to find the natural levels of DDT residues in a selected marine invertebrate, noting individual variations, as well as variation with respect to locality, age, sex, and type of tissue; and 2) to map the pathway after ingestion of labeled DDT through the body of the same organism. The lined shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, was studied, since preliminary investigations suggested it was accumulating significant amounts of DDT. This study indicates that excretion may play a decisive role in maintaining some sort of DDT level equilibrium between an organism and its environment. If this is indeed true, the present theory of pesticide accumulation through food chains may have to be re-evaluated.","128":"Marine copepods (Calanus helgolandicus) were classified as visibly unaffected, visibly affected, or dead after varying periods of incubation in varying concentrations of DDT. At twenty-four hours, 50% were affected (visibly affected + dead) by a predicted 60ppb; at 48 hours, 50% were affected by a predicted 5.8ppb. It was found that1 ppb DDT increased the rate of respiration over that of the controls.","129":"The ambient levels of DDE (approximately 80% of total DDT residues) were determined in the northern anchovy from gas chromatographic analysis of 25 samples of 6 different tissues: female gonad, male gonad, liver, muscle, gill, and brain. Levels were found to range between, 0.11 and 0.35 ppm by wet weight. Direct uptake from seawater by live fish was measured with the use of C14 labeled DDT for four hour incubations in 1 ppb concentrations. Results showed very high concentrations of the DDT in liver, gill, and brain. In four hours liver tissue concentrated DDT an average of 240 times over the initial level, with gill and brain tissue averaging 65 and 45 fold concentrations, respectively, in the same time period. Results show large variations between individual fish in amount and site of deposition. Comparison of normal levels and uptake show that DDT is highly mobile within the fish and seems to move from liver to muscle tissue after original uptake.","130":"The filter feeding san crab, Emerita analoga, is abundant in sandy beaches on California shores. It is an important food source for the Barred Surfperch and several shore birds including the Snowy Plover, Sanderling, and Sandpiper. Several California birds and fishes contain high levels of DDT and its derivatives. Emerita is in a position to concentrate DDT residues from water, plankton, and detritus, and pass them on to fishes and fords through the food chain. To measure the rate of uptake of DDT from seas water, sand crabs were exposed to solution of C14-DDT at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 ppb for 12 hours. Sand crabs burrowed in sand took up a constant amount of DDT in concentrations of 0.4 ppb 1.0 ppb (increases from 10x to 25x). Sand crabs free in sea water took up amounts of DDT proportional to the DDT concentration in the sea water (an increase of 55x). Natural levels of DDT residues were determined by gas liquid chromatography in populations of sand crabs from the mouth of the Salinas Rive, which drains and agricultural valley where DDT use is widespread, and from Asilomar Beach, an exposed ocean beach several miles away. Approximately 80ppb of DDE were found in both populations. Only trace amounts of DDT were present in sand crabs from Asilomar Beach, while approximately 140 ppb were found in sand crabs from the mouth of the Salinas River.","131":"Using an elective culture medium for denitrifying pseudomonads, anaerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures containing the following compounds present as the only source of carbon: DDT, DDD, DDA, p-chloromandelic acid, p-chlorocumene, p-chloroanisole, and sodium acetate. Aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures containing the following carbon compounds present in a similar elective culture medium deficient in nitrate: DDT, DDA, DDD, p-chloromandelic acid, p-chlorocumene, p-chloroanisole, p-chlorotoluene, and sodium acetate. An actinomycete was isolated from aerobic cultures with DDT, DDD, p-chlorocumene, and p-chloroanisole.","132":"Pesticidal pollution of Monterey Bay, California has been suggested as the cause of an unusually large number of bird deaths reported in the past year. Analyses were performed on a series of dead or dying birds and mammals taken from the Monterey Bay area. Concentrations of DDT and its analogs DDE and DDD were determined by gas chromatography. Results were as follows: 107, 105, and 155 ppm DDE in livers of three Brandt's cormorants; 192 and 292 ppm DDE in livers of two Western grebes; 2.35 ppm DDE in the liver and 121 ppm DDE in the sub-cutaneous fat of an arctic loon; 4.25 ppm DDE in the liver and 0.61 ppm DDE in the ovary of a second arctic loon; 373 ppm DDE in the liver of a fork-tailed petrel; 412 ppm DDE in the liver of an ashy petrel; 805 ppm DDE in the liver of a Western gull; 41.5 ppm DDE in the liver of a ring-billed gull; 1.2 ppm DDE in the liver of an aborted Stellar sea lion pup; and 3.94 and 89 ppm DDE in the livers of two immature Californian sea lions.","133":"Preliminary investigations using radioactively labeled DDT indicate that 50-90% of the DDT at a low concentration in water is codistilled with as little as 5-20% loss of water by evaporation over a 48 hour period. Under a constant air flow as much as 15% of this loss is recovered by water and particulate material of a second solution placed in series. Particulate matter in the second solution concentrates DDT 1000 to 50,000 times the level in the ambient water, depending both on the surface area and nature of the particles. Experiments with the bay mussel, Mytilus edulis suggest that filter feeders can readily incorporate DDT from water and particulate matter. These results indicate that codistillation and air currents may important in transporting significant quantities of DDT to the marine environment where it may enter the food chain. The variation of levels of DDT on glassware, suspended particles, and in the sea water suggest that an equilibrium exists between the DDT adsorbed on various materials that are found in the surrounding water.","134":"The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of the Pacific Grove, California sewage outfall on the adjacent shore areas as measured by the distributions, with respect to the point of discharge, of common intertidal organisms, and to related these results to local currents and to other parameters of pollution, including plots of phosphate concentration, dissolved oxygen levels, and coliform bacteria counts.","135":"Both DDT and DDE inhibit bovine red cell carbonic anhydrase. Between 3 X 10 ^(-8) and 15 X 10 ^(-8) moles in the assay tube produced 50% inhibition. Homogenated Mytilus mantle appeared to be uninhibited by as high as 3 X 10^(-5) moles of DDT. Mytilus californianus taken from Monterey Bay, California were found to contain 84 ppb of DDT and residues. Sulfanilamide, an additional inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase was capable of inhibiting the mussel enzyme. Only crude homogenates were used in theses studies. Inhibition of mussel carbonic anhydrase should be studied using purified enzyme preparations. DDT (at 3 X 10 ^(-3) M) did not inhibit carbonic anhydrase activity in crude homogenates of the mantle tissue of Mytilus californianus. Sulfanilamide at 3 X 10 ^(-5) M inhibited the Mytilus homogenates. DDT and DDE at 10^(-5) M produce 50% inhibition of bovine red cell carbonic anhydrase.","136":"Growth of aerobic pseudomonads in elective cultures was significantly inhibited by DDT in concentrations as low a s 2 ppm. No effect upon aerobic respiration was detected.","137":"Citharichthys stigmaeus of a first year class population were analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the concentration of DDT residues on various tissues. Liver contained 2.6 ppm DDE (wet weight). Gut and brain tissue contained 0.3 and 0.23 ppm respectively, while gills and muscle had lower concentrations of 0.073 and 0.064 ppm DDE. Un uptake experiments, fish were incubated in 1 ppb C14-labeled DDT for various times up to 36 hours. Appreciable label was found in all tissues after 30 minutes, increasing to high concentrations in the liver, gut and brain after 24 hours. Lower, but significant uptake was found in the skin, gills and muscle. Fish pulsed for 4 hours in 1 ppb C14-DDT and subsequently transferred to natural sea water provided data on DDT excretion. Gills averaged a 90% loss of the initial pulse label, while skin, liver, gut, brain and muscle retained 80-110% of the DDT after a 72 hour incubation.","138":"Methods have been developed for observing the effects of DDT on the development of the larval skeleton in the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). These include uptake studies with C14-labeled DDT to determine the amount taken up by the developing embryo, direct observations of skeletal growth, and observations of other factors which might indicate a general depressing effect of DDT such as rate of cleavage, time of hatching, and rate of protein synthesis.","139":"Studies were made of the effects of Picloram at various concentrations on whole water samples and cultures established from tows from Monterey Bay, California, using the C-14 and oxygen light\/dark bottle techniques. The rate of net photosynthesis was depressed approximately 10% by a herbicide concentration of one part per million by weight and 89% by a herbicide concentration of one hundred parts per million by weight. No significant effects of the herbicide on respiration was detected at these concentrations.","140":"Mytilus californianus maintained in solutions of filtered seawater of 1.0, 0.1,0.01, and 0.001 ppb DDT showed no consistent change in rate of respiration or filtering. Mytilus fed on Nitzschia in a 1 ppb DDT solution increased the level of DDT in the soft tissues to 562 (range 29 - 911) ppb in 24 hours; to 880 (range 451 - 1358) ppb in 48 hours; to 1253 (range 390 - 2056) ppb in 72 hours; and to 1307 (range 641 - 2692) ppb in 96 hours. Measurements of respiration and filtering rates taken of subsamples of the test group at 24 hour intervals showed no significant difference between the test organisms exposed to DDT and the controls. Mytilus californianus can concentrate DDT in its soft tissues up to 2.7 ppm by wet weight with no apparent reduction in the rates of filtering or respiration.","141":"C14-DDT uptake by populations of mixed phytoplankton are investigated by centrifugation and liquid scintillation techniques. Plankton in culture densities of 0.03 mg\/ml to 0.41 mg\/ml in C14-DDT solutions of 0.3 to 100 ppb showed DDT concentrations (gm DDT\/ gm dry weight plankton) of 210 ppb to 170 ppm. Concentration factors comparing final DDT concentrations in cells with initial solution concentrations are found between 700 and 13000. Phytoplankton take up between 40% and 70% of the DDT in solution in less than four hours and generally less than 15 minutes. Formalin killed cells take up the same amount of DDT as live cells. Lugol preservative killed cells take up less DDT than live cells. Cells incubated in dark B.O.D. bottles take up the same amount of DDT as cells incubated in the light. Less dense cultures concentrate DDT more than dense cultures. Plankton appear to concentrate DDT more in dilute DDT solutions than in concentrated solutions. Phytoplankton containing DDT removed to dilute DDT solution retained 70% to 90% of their DDT after two hours.","142":"A study was performed on direct uptake and deposition of DDT-C14 from seawater by the intertidal teleost Cebedichthys violaceus Ayres. It was found that the liver concentrated DDT to the greatest extent, followed by brain, gills, and muscle. After a rapid uptake during the first two hours of incubation, the rate was seen to decrease to a certain extent, possibly due to removal of most of the DDT from the water. The ability of the fish to absorb and concentrate DDT from concentrations comparable to those found in natural waters was also studied, and it was found that the total amount of DDT absorbed decreased in more dilute solutions, but that the factor of concentration greatly increased. The significance of direct uptake, from very dilute concentrations is discussed.","143":"The rocky headland known as Point Pinos, Monterey County, Cal., receives approximately 1.5 million gallons of primarily treated sewage daily. Adjacent areas to the sewage outfall mouth, located intertidally, are visibly deficient in fauna and flora typical of the rocky Monterey coast. The purpose of this six week investigation was to determine whether the sewage effluent affects the bacterial and diatomaceous films known to produce a substratum for the metamorphosis of attached invertebrate larvae. The importance of this early film to invertebrate larval attachment has been debated for many years. The study described here attempts to correlate variations in microfilm formation with proximity to the Pacific Grove sewage outfall.","144":"1) Anthopleura elegantissima is distributed around the outfall according to a gradient which parallels gradients of physical and chemical properties related to the presence of sewage effluent. 2) Anemones placed in the field become detached from their substrates more frequently as they approach the outfall. 3) LT-50's of animals placed in Monterey sewage were longer than those tested in unchlorinated Pacific Grove effluent. These in turn were longer still than those tested in chlorinated Pacific Grove sewage. 4) Concentrations of sewage necessary to produce toxicity in the laboratory were far greater than the effective concentrations of sewage experienced by anemones in the field. 5) Observations of the reactions of anemones to concentrated sewage and to field observations suggested that field populations were being directly effected by the primary effluent. 6) All of the evidence from this study suggests that sewage is responsible for the peculiar distribution of anemones in the study area around the outfall.","145":"The benthic red alga Prionitis lanceolata Harvey shows an increased primary productivity in the outfall canyon of the Carmel, California, marine sewage outfall. At a distance of 20 meters from the outfall this productivity show a large reduction before again rising to a high value at approximately 20 -40 meters. The differing productivities of samples from Mission Point, Monastery Beach, and Cabrillo Point (Hopkins Marine Station) are compared in relation to the currents which were found. Possible causes for these differences in productivity are discussed. The validity of the \" light and dark bottle\" method of benthic algal productivity measurement used here is also discussed.","146":"The distribution of phytoplankton at Pt. Pinos was studied by periodic sampling at 13 stations on and off shore. Counts showed that numbers of phytoplankton on the outfall side of Pt. Pinos were always larger on the average than numbers on the opposite side. In addition, offshore samples had far fewer individuals than shore samples. These results suggest that the phytoplankton nearest the outfall may benefit from an excess of inorganic nutrients in the sewage, but this cannot be concluded from the data. Mixed cultures of two species of diatoms, Nitzschia closterium and Navicula were grown in different dilutions of sewage from Monterey and Pacific Grove. Growth of N. closterium was inhibited by both kinds of sewage. Navicula grew well in Monterey sewage but very poorly in Pacific Grove sewage. Nutrients in the sewage probably tend to promote growth while chlorine or other toxic substances might act as inhibiting factors.","147":"1) The area of Monterey Bay near the Monterey City Outfall Line was investigated for relationships between dissolved oxygen and nutrient levels and changes in biogeochemical cycles during a day-night study period. 2) It was found that neither oxygen levels decreased enough nor did hydrogen sulfide levels increase enough to pose immediate toxicity to fish life during the period of study. 3) Levels of hydrogen sulfide, oxygen, and to a lesser extent, nitrite, are dependent upon a day-night cycle. Phosphate seems to be dependent to a greater extent upon the volume of effluent being released from the outfall. Nitrate shows no obvious correlation with either factor. 4) Phosphate is found in greatest quantities at the surface. Hydrogen sulfide and nitrite are found in slightly increased levels towards the bottom depths. Nitrate does not show any obvious gradient with depth. 5) Stability of phosphate seems to make it a better indicator of effluent flow direction and rate than the other nutrients studied. 6) Using phosphate as an indicator, it is suggested that much of the effluent of the Monterey City Outfall is flowing southward and pooling in a dead water area near the Monterey Wharf number 2, enriching the area considerably.","148":"The abundance and distribution of microfauna found associated with Prionitis lanceolata at a point chosen to represent an unpolluted natural environment. The results of this study were compared to the results of a previous study made in the Pt. Pinos area. Also, areas at Pt. Pinos were resampled to determine the effects of seasonal variation on microfaunal communities. Results indicate that differences in microfaunal community structure observed at Pt. Pinos are greater than those attributable to the effects of natural variation. Seasonal variation was found to have little effect in the Pt. Pinos area. From these results a hypothesis for testing pollution damage in an area was formulated.","149":"The effect of primary treated sewage on the distribution and abundance of microfauna found associated with three species of algae, characteristic of the low, mid, and high intertidal, was studied. The results show that the sewage effluent affects the distribution of microfauna most strongly in Prionitis lanceolata and Corralina vancouveriensis, algae representatives of mid and low intertidal species. Microfauna associated with Endocladia muricata, the representative alga of the high intertidal, was affected only in the immediate region of the outfall. Information from current studies and chemical-physical assays in the study area allowed a hypothesis of effluent dispersal and effect to be made. Certain species, by their presence or absence on algae in the immediate outfall area, seem to be possible indicators of marine pollution.","150":"A study was made of the populations of intermediate sized interstitial organisms of Del Monte Beach, Monterey, California. In the summer of 1969 this beach was closed because of sewage pollution from the city's offshore outfall. It was expected that populations of organisms constantly exposed to this pollution might be affected. Samples were taken at every 100 meters on a transect running 1000 meters north and 1500 meters south. Counts were substantially lower to the north than to the south. This appears to be correlated to the southerly flow of the sewage as reported by several other investigators. A general enrichment of the environment is considered to account for the increase in population.","151":"1) Sewage from the Monterey treatment plant does not make a gross contribution to the organic carbon content of the ambient sea water. It merely amplifies existing patterns of decomposition. 2) The hours of the maximum input of organic carbon into the environment from the outfall are not predictable. 3) Anaerobes can decompose organic carbon. 4) Under aerobic conditions, organic carbon in sea water and sewage undergoes qualitative changes making it less resistant to microbial and dichromate oxidation.","152":"For years, the standard method for an assay of pollution has been a test for the presence of coliform bacteria, under the assumption that these indicate the presence of other, more harmful bacteria. While this test may be useful from a public health viewpoint, it fails to indicate the presence of sewage itself, which these studies show, may contain more materials harmful to the environment than coliform bacteria themselves. This paper will suggest a new type of indicator, that of varying legal distribution around an intertidal outfall area, as a helpful measure of the extent of total pollution.","153":"Observation of the floral community surrounding an intertidal sewage outfall shows that some species of benthic algae and marine plant are able to exist in areas of high sewage concentrations, while other species cannot tolerate this altered environment. However, even the most resistant species are small and stunted in the immediate vicinity of the outfall. One of the most salient characteristics of sewage pollution is the increased turbidity caused by the suspended particulate matter in the sewage. An experiment was designed to answer two questions: 1) does turbidity effect the productivity of marine flora, and 2) does turbidity have a different effect on difference species. In all species studied the productivity decreased markedly at high turbidities. The productivities of the three species studied also showed differences in their rates of decline as the turbidity increased.","154":"1. In the period 29 April to 27 May 1970 studies of the distribution, reproduction, recruitment, and pigments of Pollicicpes polymerus were carried out on populations in both polluted and unpolluted areas. 2. Near sewage outfalls Pollicipes clusters may be abundant; however, they lack associated biota of polychaetes, amphipods, limpets and epizoic algae. The are loosely attached to rocks and are usually covered with an algal slime. 3. Within a 230 foot radius of an outfall with high residual chlorine the barnacles were not reproducing. Recruitment occurred only on the outer fringes of the area. At a second outfall with lower residual chlorine a few Pollicipes were reproducing and some recruitment was occurring within four feet of the mouth of the pipe. The levels of reproduction and recruitment here were lower than in unpolluted areas. 4. Pollicipes shows decreasing damage with increasing distance form the outfalls. 5. Thin layer chromatogram studies show that several carotenoid pigments found in the stalk hemolymph of dermal Pollicipes are lacking in individuals living near sewer outfalls. 6. Pollicipes appears to have some value as a quantitative indicator of the effects of marine sewage pollution.","155":"In these experiments, samples of the hermit crab, Pagurus samuelis were taken from polluted and unpolluted areas around the southern end of Monterey Bay. These samples were tested for their righting response times and a summary of the results of these tests follows: 1. When righting response time was measured immediately after capture, crabs from unpolluted waters (Hopkins Marine Station) measured in unpolluted water exhibited a significantly faster righting response than crabs from polluted areas timed in water from their environments. 2. Crabs from polluted water (Point Pinos) placed in unpolluted water for 24 hours showed a significant increase in the speed of righting. 3. crabs from Hopkins Marine Station immersed in 2% and 4% dilutions of sewage exhibited a significant decrease in their speed of righting after 24 hours.","156":"California sea mussels (Mytilus californianus) of 2 to 5 cm length were collected from intertidal areas in Pacific Grove, California, during May. they were placed in various dilutions of primary unchlorinated sewage and their respiration was measured. Results indicate that sewage causes changes in respiratory activity, and that high concentrations are extremely toxic. An attempt was made to isolate the toxic factors but proved unsuccessful. Data for the excretion of dissolved inorganic phosphate by the mussels are also presented.","157":"1) Unchlorinated sewage is a relatively mild fertilization inhibitor. 2) Chlorinated sewage is a very strong fertilization inhibitor, and a concentration of available chlorine as low as 0.04 ppm can reduce fertilization. 3) The primary effect of both chlorinated and unchlorinated sewage is on the sperm. 4) The effect of unchlorinated sewage is partially reversible. 5) The sodium hypochlorite - sodium thiosulfate pair is a potential tool in rate study determinations of fertilizations.","158":"This research project examined to effects of primary treated effluent on the distribution and abundance of marine intertidal fauna in a portion of Carmel Bay, California. During the time of the current studies the effluent was moving south from the outfall and appeared to remain in the Monastery Beach area due to circular currents. The sewage was not moving straight out to sea. Damage in the outfall area can be seen in the form of distribution patterns and are reflected in the diversity indices for specific types of areas. The distribution patterns suggest that Mytilus californianus (California mussel), Mitella polymerus (Gooseneck barnacle), Balanus glandula, Chthamalus spp., Tetraclita squamosa rubsecens, Acmaea spp., Pisaster ochraceus, Pagurus spp., and Haliotis cracherodii may be good intertidal indicators of sewage pollution. Toxicity tests on Acmaea degitalis and A. scutum suggest that at low concentrations of sewage, Cl2 may be responsible for much of the lethality of the sewage. However, Cl2 does not account for the entire toxicity of any concentration of sewage. The research outlined in this paper suggests further investigations are necessary to confirm present information about current and effluent movement in Carmel Bay, the toxicity of sewage due to Cl2, the toxicity of other sewage components, distribution and diversity patterns as measureable parameters of sewage pollution, and the development of other types of indicators of sewage pollution.","159":"The effects of sewage on sand dollar and sea urchin development were studied. Time required to reach different morphological stages and rate of skeleton growth were used as parameters. Studies were also carried out on culture conditions necessary to raise embryos beyond the pluteus stage. The development was adversely effected by sewage if the concentration was greater than 5% (unchlorinated). A slight enhancement was often observed in 1% sewage, at least during the first 100 hours.","160":"1) Pagurus is absent within a 100 foot radius of the Pacific Grove sewage outfall. No abnormalities in the patterns of distribution of Pagurus were found outside the 100 foot radius. 2) field cages containing P. samuelis placed within a 100 foot radius of the outfall showed 100% mortality in 28 days. Beyond this distance, mortalities did not exceed those in unpolluted areas. 3) Chlorinated sewage (residual chlorine 15-45 ppm) was the only one of several solutions tested in the laboratory (including dechlorinated sewage) showing significant mortality in 20% and 105 concentrations. Chlorine was probably the cause of deaths recorded in field cages within 100 feet of the outfall; laboratory studies showed sewage without chlorine could not account for this mortality except in concentrations above 50%. 4) Fresh water is a component of sewage toxic to P. samuelis at salinities of 0 -17 o\/oo, but not toxic at 27 o\/oo and above in 15 days. 5) Other toxic components are present in sewage since mortality exceeding that of controls was recorded in sewage which was dechlorinated and osmotically balanced. 6) P. samuelis tends to move away from solutions with salinities at 27 o\/oo or below, but this alone probably cannot explain the absence of this species within the 100 foot radius of the outfall. 7) P. samuelis is not a sensitive indicator for unchlorinated sewage, but is very sensitive to chlorinated sewage. If sewage is not chlorinated, P. samuelis could survive for prolonged periods in 20% concentration of sewage.","161":"The gametes, early stages of development, and adult Patiria are all affected by sewage and its associated levels of chlorination. Effects on the adult ranged from an abstinence from feeding behavior in concentrations of sewage greater than 5%, to death within 24 hours when placed near the outfall. The fertilization process was somewhat sensitive to chlorinated sewage. Thus, more than twice as many embryos were able to reach the blastula stage in 10% and 5% sewage solutions if the eggs were fertilized before being placed in the sewage dilutions. Hypochlorite was found to be the active ingredient in chlorinated sewage. The sperm were more sensitive to the hypochlorite than the eggs, showing a reduction in the ability to fertilize eggs in concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm. Because of the high sensitivity of fertilization to both chlorinated and unchlorinated sewage, the ecological effects of the sewage may extend far down current from the damaged area near the outfall.","162":"Four species of intertidal algae, two Rhodophyta and two Phaeophyta were collected from around the sewage outfall at Point Pinos, Pacific Grove, California. The algal samples were analyzed for relative pigment content through the use of comparative spectrophotometry and thin layer chromatography. The brown algae directly reflected sewage distribution and concentrations (established in other studies), by morphological damage and by a reduction in pigment content. The red algae showed various degrees of increased pigment content in the more polluted areas. Possible answers to the increase in pigments are briefly discussed. Mention is made of the possibility of using inter-and\/or-subtidal brown algal pigment content as an indicator of sewage distribution near an outfall. Some pertinent morphological and ecological observations of algae in the heavily polluted areas are noted.","163":"This project involved the determination of the persistence of residual Chlorine in sea water and the deamination of any effects, either adverse or positive, or residual Chlorine from chlorinated sewage effluents on the photosynthetic activities of three representative algae, Prinonitis lanceolata (Rhodophyta), Ulva lobata (Chlorophyta), and Macrocystis pyrifera (Phaeophyta). By using the technique of quantitative C14 -O2 uptake to measure the rates of photosynthesis, a correlation between the concentrations of Sodium Hypochlorite in the experimental media and the experimental rates of photosynthetic activity was discovered. The results show that a residual level of 5 ppm Chlorine in sea water does adversely affect the photosynthetic activities of these algae, in the case of Ulva lobata by as much as 25%. Higher concentrations of residual chlorine have even greater effects, with 15 ppm residual chlorine giving an 80% reduction in the photosynthetic rate of Macrocystis pyrifera.","164":"1. A relationship between the amount of urease activity in marine beach sediments and proximity to sewage outfalls has been demonstrated. 2. The amount of urease activity detectable is directly related to sediment particle size and can be related to the number of Proteus vulgaris added to sterile sediments. 3. Proteus vulgaris, a typical urease producer and an inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract show substantial survival in marine materials.","165":"1. Eighteen species of ascidians taken near Monterey, California, were analyzed for chromium content using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 2. The highest values (ppm dry weight) were found in the genera Eudistoma (E. psammion, 152.5; E. ritteri, 25.6; E. molle, 15.0) and Ritterella (R. pulchra, 69.6; R. rubra, 45.2). All are members of the Order Aplousobranchia. The lowest value was obtained in Stylea montereyensis (1.59 ppm dry weight). Seawater taken by the Hopkins Marine Station yielded a value of 0.095 ppm. 3. The chromium content o fascidians found near local domestic sewage outfalls was often lower than that of ascidians found in less polluted areas. The chromium concentration in three different samples of domestic sewage effluent (ranging from 0.000 to 0.008 ppm) was much lower than that in seawater from Monterey Bay (0.095 ppm).","166":"A study was conducted on the coliform distribution in seawater samples and in M. californianus (conrad, 1837) for Carmel Bay, Calif. Populations of Mytilus were small in areas where effluent concentration was large. No adults were found in the immediate vicinity of the outfall. Determination of coliform levels in M. californianus was unsuccessful. Coliform concentrations could not be correlated with direction of effluent for distances over 270 feet. Onshore coliform counts were predominantly higher than offshore samples. A rise in coliform counts occurred toward the end of May.","167":"Petroleum products vary considerably in their composition, and consequently, they differ in toxicity to living systems. In this study, the effects of various dilutions of different kinds of oils were tested on the fertilization and early development of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Most of the oils had little effect in the fertilization, but many of them did inhibit early cleavage. Crude oils and heavy bunker oils were the most toxic to cleavage, even at concentrations of 6.25% saturation, while the diesel and jet fuels were the least toxic.","168":"Inorganic copper and mercury, at concentrations as low as a half part per million in sea water, reduced photosynthesis in samples of Porphyra perforata. Similar effects were observed in phytoplankton using even lower concentrations of copper in solution. Neither the mercuric or cupric ions indicated and any effects on plant respiration nor any signs of synergistic action as inhibitors of photosynthesis in Porphyra","169":"Plankton samples from the surface and ten meters depth were collected in Monterey Bay and analyzed for DDT residues. The results show a trend toward higher concentration at the air-sea interface. Possible mechanisms of concentration are discussed, with some consideration given to ecological implications.","170":"1. Qualitative studies of reproduction and quantitative studies of total and individual carotenoid content in the stalked barnacle Pollicipes polymerus were carried out for animals in polluted and non polluted areas in the Monterey Bay area of California. 2. Reproductive activity was retarded in areas very close to point sources of pollution. 3. The total carotenoid content in the stalk fluid of Pollicipes was invariably lowest in animals close to point sources of pollution, concomitantly, the amount of carotenoid tended to increase with increasing distance from such pollution sources. 4. It was suggested that total carotenoid content may be effected by proximity to sewage effluent whereas astaxanthin content may be specifically effected by increased chlorine concentrations. 5. Possible mechanisms governing the decrease in Pollicipes carotenoid content are discussed.","171":"1. Analyses of Mytilus edulis shell for the trace metals Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co and Cd using atomic absorption spectrophotometry is difficult because of scattering effects at low wavelengths. To eliminate these interferences, experiments were performed with the use of an ion-exchange resin column of Chelex-100 with the result that scattering was completely eliminated from the samples of shells. 2. A method of concentrating a solution of trace metals by evaporation under suction was developed. This method resulted in a 100% recovery of all trace metals from a solution that had been concentrated ten times. This in effect increased the detection limit of the atomic absorption spectrophotometer ten times. 3. At a sample pH of 7.0, the Chelex column used had a generally higher percentage recovery for solutions of trace metals without shell material than for solutions with shell material. 4. Recovery percentage from the column for all the trace metals involved was much higher at sample pH of 7.8 than that at sample pH of 7.0. 5. Reagent contamination resulted in some inaccuracies in the values for some trace metals in the shells of Mytilys edulis, especially copper and zinc. When the concentration of some of the trace metals in the mussel shell are so low, contamination becomes an all-important consideration. Furthermore, the varying amounts of the inherently contaminated ammonium hydroxide used in the samples added an increased degree of variance to the results.","172":"Five columns, two extraction procedures, and three cleanup methods were tested for efficiency in the detection and isolation of methyl mercury in both fish and plant material. A 1\/8\" x 6' stainless steel column packed with chromasorb W (80-100 mesh) on carbowax 20 M was used in the final measurements. Between 85 and 100% of the mercury in Bonita samples was methylated. No methyl mercury was found in macrocystis.","173":"A survey was made of the concentrations of Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn found in the sand crab, Emerita analoga, and the sand it inhabits from various points in the Monterey Bay area of California. Geographical differences in concentrations were documented and correlations between these concentration patterns and possible point sources of contaminant input associated with domestic, industrial, and agricultural effluents were drawn. In addition, the effect of local current patterns in the concentration of various heavy metal pollutants was suggested by the research. The results suggest the Emerita may be a useful biogeographical marker of trace metal levels in the sandy beach environment.","174":"The presence of domestic sewage pollution in the marine environment around Monterey Bay was studied. Escherichia coli strain B was used for coliphage detection. Studies found that coliphage survive longer and were distributed further from an outfall tan coliform bacteria. Even though the viruses appeared to be in large numbers only around sewage input sources into the sea and were not ubiquitous in the marine environment, small amounts of phage could be detected at distances away from input systems. Filtration of water samples prior to dilution in phage assays was not desirable.","175":"The effects of different concentrations of several heavy metals on the righting behavior of Littorina planaxis were studied. Part of the animals' shells were removed they were then submerged in sea water that contained different concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead and silver. The effects of these treatments were assayed by timing the animals' righting response. The results obtained show that cadmium, copper, and silver have significant effects only at high concentrations. Lead was shown to have no significant short-term effects.","176":"Determinations of Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were made by atomic absorption spectrophotometry on 7 species of Mollusca in the genera Acmaea, Tegula, Thais (gastropods), and Mytilus, Protothaca, and Tapes (bivalves). Eleven regions along the California coast from San Francisco Bay to Los Angeles were included. Separate analyses were performed on shells, and on portions of whole bodies. Highest levels, above 900 ppm Pb were found in bodies of Acmaea digitalis, 570 ppm Cu and 1700 ppm zn in bodies of Thais emarginata","177":"Samples of fishes from the Pajaro River and Elkhorn Slough were analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbon residues. All DDT\/PCB ratios for flesh and whole fish samples were less than 1.2; ratios were substantially greater than 1 in leopard shark liver samples. The possibility that the high concentration of DDT stored in the liver tissue is antagonistic to PCB storage is discussed. The percentage of total PCB content present in combined mono, di, and trichlorobiphenyls for the five species taken fro the Pajaro River was found to exhibit a slight inverse relationship to the idealized trophic levels on which these fishes feed. PCB's more than DDT levels tended to increase in these same five fishes as one moved up this simplified fraction of a food chain. Samples from the Pajaro River were compared to the same species captured in Elkhorn Slogh and found to have significantly greater PCB and DDT concentrations.","178":"Large motor aberrations were observed in the sand crab, Emerita analoga, allowed to concentrate DDT from seawater to 1.4 ppm. This is close to some levels found in the field. In recordings made form a nerve innervating the abdominal flexor muscles, 1 ppm DDT in the bathing medium greatly increases spontaneous neuronal bursting, length of tactually stimulated bursts and frequency of firing of the larger motor neurons. These effects appear cumulative and irreversible. Animals bathed in 100 ppb DDT and animals with 1.4 ppm DDT taken up over 12 days showed lesser but similar neurophysiological effects. Behavioral effects at concentrations found in the natural environment is deemed possible.","179":"In an effort to determine the effectiveness of the sand crab, Emerita analoga, as an indicator species of DDT levels in the California coastal marine environment, specimens were collected from different beaches on Monterey Bay and analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). After all initial samples were analyzed, it was found that ovigerous animals contained much lower levels of DDT than non-ovigerous animals. Since the bulk of the samples for the different beaches had differing proportions of ovigerous to non-ovigerous animals, and this difference was not recorded, the effectiveness of this species as an indicator of DDT was not fully demonstrated. However, the specimens collected do represent natural populations from the various beaches, and a rough comparison is possible. Since DDE is reported to increase with time in a biological system, the relative amount of DDE to the total residues of DDT was determined for each beach and the data was analyzed for possible trends. Sand samples were also collected at each beach, when the Emerita were collected, and comparison of DDT levels in the sand with those in the animals made.","180":"The sensitivity of sea urchin egg fertilization was tested in waters of various degrees chlorinated and unchlorinated domestic sewage. Chlorine in sewage, especially diluted sewage, was found to strongly inhibit sea urchin fertilization. Removal of chlorine suggested that there were other pollutants present in sewage effluent. The sea urchin fertilization bioassay may be useful in indicating pollution though it cannot act a the sole indicator of water quality.","181":"Plankton samples from the surface and from 10 meters depth were collected in Monterey Bay and analyzed for Ag, Zn, Cu, Cr, Mn, Cd, and Pb. The results showed a trend toward higher concentration at the air-sea interface. Possible mechanisms of concentration processes are discussed, with some consideration given to the ecological implications.","182":"Preliminary investigations of several aspects of DDT residue flow through the food chain were carried out using GLC analysis and C14-DDT tracer. These consisted of measurement of field concentration levels, uptake from water, uptake through feeding, and determination of accumulation sites. Results indicate that more DDT is available to the organism over time than is accumulated, suggesting an equilibrium of DDT residue concentration between animal and environment. A thorough description of DDT flow in the food chain will require more detailed information on the kinetics at each level. The study will continue with investigation of DDT kinetics in Hermissenda.","183":"Results show an equilibrium for surface uptake, establishing a constant DDT concentration in the cerata with a 5 to 10 ppt concentration in the water, a level likely to be present in the habitat. A two compartment model is proposed for the uptake mechanism. Spawning is shown to be the primary pathway for DDT output, eliminating as much as 50% of the residues taken up during each 10 to 20 day egg production period, but not eliminating DDT residues already stored in the cerata. Field levels show an increasing whole body concentration with increasing age, probably dependent on feeding dosage, but difficult to determine without additional autecological knowledge of Hermisssenda.","184":"Sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and S. franciscanus) in the vicinity of the Los Angeles County sewer at White's Point have abnormal spination (stunted and missing primary spines). There are very high DDT residue levels (mainly DDE) in the tissues of these animals compared with normal appearing animals found at Pigeon Point, San Mateo County. Calcification rates in regenerating spines of S. purpuratus from White's Point were one-half the rates of regenerating spines of S. purpuratus from Pigeon Point. DDT in concentrations above 1 ug\/ml appears to suppress calcification in regenerating spines of S purpuratus from White's Point exposed to DDT concentrations up to 10 ug\/ml. Accumulated pesticide residues contained in the spines of the White's Point urchins apparently suppresses calcification and may be a major cause of their stunted, abnormal appearing spination.","185":"Amounts of Ag, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn were measured in the hermit crab Pagurus samuelis from eight locations on the California coast between San Francisco and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Highest and lowest average values obtained were: Ag (5.0-1.5), Cd (3.1-1.2), Cu (200.7-44.6), Mn (24.2-6.5), Pb (23.4-14.8), and Zn (108.8-76.4). Females did not differ significantly from males for most metals in most areas. High levels of zinc and copper in Pagurus samuelis show some relation to possible local sources in the environment.","186":"The sites of concentration of trace metals cadmium, lead, silver, copper, chromium, manganese and zinc were determined for five species of inshore marine fishes. Generally, zinc and lead accumulate in the gills; copper, cadmium, and zinc accumulate in the liver; and silver, zinc, manganese, chromium, and cadmium concentrate in bone. Flesh doesn't noticeably concentrate any of these elements. Concentration levels with regard to trophic levels were also examined, and it was found that manganese in the liver, and zinc in flesh and bone decrease in concentration with increasing trophic level. Cadmium in the liver may show a direct relationship of concentration with higher trophic levels.","187":"Report contains information, tables, and graphs concerning the amount of DDT residues in sediment samples collected weekly at sites along the northern Salinas River between April 27 and May 17, 1971. A detailed explanation of the extraction technique with a recovery study is included. Conclusions indicate that total DDT derivatives range from 2 to 500 ppb at various sites. Preliminary information about the mode of DDT residue translocation and reasons for concentration is also presented.","188":"Pagurus samuelis were collected from eight locations on the California coast between San Francisco and Los Angeles. It was found that DDT residue concentration levels at six of the eight locations were relatively low, ranging from .6 ppb to 6.9 ppb. While levels at Monterey Harbor (mean value 36 ppb) and White's Point (mean value 840 ppb) were much higher. Some possible explanations for this difference are given. There was no significant difference between levels in males as compared to ovigerous females of the same populations.","189":"Trace metal analysis of 23 species of common Pacific Coast marine foods revealed high cadmium values for Bent-nosed clams (Macoma nasuta), Bay mussels (Mytilus edulis), Bay oysters (Ostrea lurida), Pacific oysters (Crassotrea gigas), and Littleneck clams (Protothaca staminea). Metals were found to concentrate in the gills, heart, and visceral mass of all 10 species of bivalve mollusks examined. Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) demonstrated the highest cadmium values for fish flesh.","190":"The four sewage plants of Monterey, Seaside, Salinas, and Pacific Grove were analyzed for trace metals in their influents, effluents, and sludges. Totaled from the four plants it was estimated that 196 grams of cadmium, 1550 grams of lead, 3500 grams of copper, 1600 grams of manganese, 14100 grams of zinc and 430 grams of silver were being dumped into the Bay daily.","191":"Three sediments were used to investigate biological reduction of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's). The sediments were collected from the Salinas River, from under Fisherman's Wharf, and from fifty fathoms in Monterey Bay, California. Sediments were spiked with Aroclors 1232 and 1268, extracted with hexane, cleaned up with a Florisil micro-column, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromotography. Only one sediment, maintained at a temperature of 25 degrees C, showed such reduction. Preparations of sediments spiked with Aroclor 1232 to provide concentrations of .5 and 5 ppm showed appreciable reduction in four week, i.e. 46.4% and 67.2% respectively. The reduction due to evaporation in the autoclaved controls was 40.8% and 38.1% respectively. The less chlorinated biphenyls showed the greatest reduction of any kind in all Aroclor 1268 preparations during the four weeks of observation, and no reduction of Aroclor 1232 in the sediments incubated at 8 C and 12 C.","192":"A 4.6 kilometer stretch of beach was sampled for polychaete distribution. Analysis shows these beach polychaetes to be divided into three groups with respect to tidal height. A high group of 4 species of sand and particle feeds clusters around the mean higher high water (+1.72 meters). A parallel group of sand and particle feeders occurs on the low beach (0.0 to 0.73 meters). A smaller group of predators spans the area from the low beach to the higher high water line. It is suggested that the polarization into high and low groups is caused by a central zone of substrate disturbance and\/or by differing moisture and organic contents. The area of study contained two gradients. The first was a vertical gradient of moisture and organic content increasing with decreasing tidal height. The second was a lateral gradient of increasing wave action and sand size, decreasing organic content and water content, and decreasing species number.","193":"Alginase activity of decomposing Macrocystis is maximal after six days of decomposition. Two forms of bacteria capable of using alginate as a sole carbon source were isolated from this decomposing material. Enzyme preparations from both forms behave very similarly. No synergistic effect could be demonstrated when the enzymes were tested in combination. This enzyme acts extra-cellularly and is relatively heat-stable, suffering on 30% inactivation after 1 hour at 100 degrees C. No elimiase activity like that described by Nakada and Sweeney (1967) was observed in the cultures or culture supernatants. These experiments suggest that the rate of decomposition of alginate is directly a function of the amount of hydrolytic alginase present and active. The use of viscosimetry for the assay of alginase activity has proved to be an accurate means for measuring this enzyme in a variety of materials. Alginate as an energy-rich food source to the sandy beach community appears to be made available to non-alginase producing organisms through microbial activity.","194":"Beach dipterans and amphipods were analyzed for heavy metal levels using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Flies showed higher concentrations of all major metals. Very high levels of cadmium were noted in both beach animals. An increase in metal level with age was evident in the dipterans. Concentrations of iron, zinc, copper, and lead were found to fluctuate significantly with time.","195":"Neomachilis halophila inhabits the spaces beneath rocks of the upper beach and shore areas just below the land vegetation. Males and females occur in equal numbers, but large females are larger than large males. Activity is largely nocturnal, and greatest activity occurs just before dawn. Common foods include unicellular green algae (from lichens), yeast, pine pollen, and vegetable detritus. Most feeding occurs during the predawn period of greatest activity.","196":"Phytoplankton productivity, standing crop, and community composition were investigated along a 15 km transect in Monterey Bay from deep water to the extreme nearshore (30m from beach) during a five week study in April and May, 1972. Consistent and significant decreased in productivity and standing crop were observed at the extreme nearshore station as compared to a station 200m offshore Community structure remained relatively stable during the period of study. Several hypotheses are offered in an attempt to explain the observed nearshore decrease.","197":"The quantity and bulk composition, by class, of drift algae on a sandy beach during a 5-week period was measured in order to estimate the potential organic input being made to the beach by the drift. Physical factors, such as high energy waves, tidal outsweep, and slope of the beach, were found to affect the quantity of the drift, as well as the composition. Three classes of algae and Phyllospadix were treated in order to determine the relative organic matter contribution being made by each mach drift component.","198":"Wrack macrofauna on North Moss Beach, Monterey County, California, were studied in an attempt to determine if a faunal succession occurs in aging wrack. Samples of naturally occurring wrack and of wrack artificially placed on the beach were collected and studied. An attempt was made to establish the relative age of wrack by determining its moisture content, assuming that wrack loses moisture gradually and steadily as it ages. However, wrack at different stages of can can have same moisture content. Therefore, no definite conclusions could be made in regard to succession in naturally occurring wrack. Yet, it was found that among wrack banks seemingly in the same general state of decay, great variation in species composition and species abundance may take place. This was also demonstrated in samples of artificial wrack over both short and long periods of time. The evidence suggests that typical terrestrial succession does not occur in wrack. Sporadic and sudden changes in species composition and species population sizes seem to be the rule. In an attempt to explain more clearly how such changes in the community of wrack macrofauna may take place with time, an hypothesis has been formulated which takes into account the spatial and temporal variability in the state of beach wrack and the mechanism by which typical wrack fauna may respond relative to possible pre-adaptations to similar kinds of environmental situations.","199":"A study of the sulfide layer on Del Monte beach in Monterey, California was conducted to determine the effects that wave size, sand size, and organic content might have on the layer. Meiofauna distributions were also examined in relation to this darkened sand. A sulfide layer was found to form under conditions of decreased wave action, decreased sand size, and increased organic content. laboratory experiments augmented these finding on sand size and organic content with increasing organic content increasing the darkness of the layer. Meiofaunal counts were found to drop sharply in the sulfide layer, not only in the number of organisms, but also in the diversity.","200":"The range and distribution of the beach isopod Allonsicus perconvexus was found to change over time. Compression and expansion of the range was observed to coincide with spring and neap tides, respectively. The upper limit of the distribution seemed to be set by moisture content of the sand, whereas extreme tidal height appeared to delimit the lower limits of the isopod's range. Range expansion and compression takes place by nighttime activity patterns. While the organism appears to be highly sensitive to the moisture content of the sand, and moves in direct relationship to moisture gradients, its activity can be modified by the presence of light, which inhibits all movement, and by a thigmotactic response which is often enhanced by the presence of potential food. Wave action and physical disturbance may reinforce those factors delineating its lower limit on the beach.","201":"The ability of Macrocystis pyrifera to accumulate trace metals in particulate form under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is examined. Under aerobic conditions, Macrocystis appears to concentrate Cd, Ni, and Mn after two weeks of decomposition. From experiments using dialysis tubes, detrital Macrocystis demonstrates the ability to concentrate Fe twenty times the concentration of standing Macrocystis.","202":"The intertidal sandy beach gastropod Olivella biplicata exhibits downslope (seaward) directional orientation as the tide ebbs toward lower low water and upslope orientation as the tide rises. Some seaward and landward movement of beach populations also occurs. These orientation changes occur whether low tides come during the day or the night.","203":"The beach wrack flies Fucellia rufitibia, Coelopa vanduzeei, and Leptocera johnsoni occupy successive vertical levels inside banks of mixed wrack found low on California beaches. When the wrack is washed away, Coelopa are then found at the sand-wrack flake interface with Leptocera; Fucellia in a black band of flies above the highest waterline. Fucellia range widely up and down the beach. Movement to higher beach positions at night seems to be associated with temperature, but some Fucellia remain in the warmer surface layers of the lower wrack banks at night. Coelopa are usually only found at lower beach positions where they inhabit the moist interior of wrack banks. Moisture and tide level are the important factors in Coelopa behavior. Mark and release experiments show that F. rufitibia do not disperse widely but constitute more or less fixed communities on the beach. C. vanduzeei are gregarious. In wrack preference experiments in the field, Fucellia and Coelopa exhibit strong preference for the surf grass Phyllospadix, probably as a source of shelter. Brown algae and mixed wrack are preferred to the same degree; red algae very little.","204":"An ecological survey was conducted along a stretch of beach in southern Monterey Bay to determine the distribution of sandy beach macrofauna with respect to a lateral wave action gradient, and other physical gradients. Biological and physical studies were performed along six intertidal transects during the spring of 1972. Sand particle size was shown to be directly correlated with wave action, and intertidal water and organic carbon content were inversely correlated. Species diversity and population densities varied inversely with wave action, particle size, and immersion frequency. Hypotheses concerning ecological stresses as applied to beach communities are offered.","205":"Larvae and pupae of Coelopa vanduzeei, Fucellia costalis, Fucellia rufitibia, and Leptoceral johnsoni were studied on two California beaches. Third instar larvae and puparia are described. Studies of distribution of larvae on the beach showed C. vanduzeei occupies lower beach wrack banks and F. costalis the upper beach banks. F. rufitibia larvae, while widespread, occur more in mid and upper beach wrack, while those of L. johnsoni are found at all levels. Larvae were observed to prefer the kelp Macrocystis both as a habitat and food source. C. vanduzeei larvae were observed in large numbers only during a two week period coinciding with a major wrack deposit. F. costalis, F. rufitibia, and L. johnsoni were found in constant numbers over 5 weeks. Duration of pupal periods in the laboratory were: C. vanduzeei, 4-9 days; L. johnsoni, 6-7 days; F. costalis and F. rufitibia 12-15 days. Average duration of the pupal period appears to increase with increasing tidal height of the larval habitat.","206":"Concentrations of silver, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc were determined in sand from beaches in the viciinity of Monterey, California. Highest concentrations of these trace metals were generally found below the surface of the sand, at low tidal levels and near populated areas. Sewage outfalls did not increase concentrations of the metals analyzed on nearby beaches.","207":"Determination of cadmium, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc were made by atomic absorption spectrophotometry on 4 species of marine algae and 1 species of marine angiosperm. Four regions along the Monterey Bay area were chosen. A correlation between fresh algal samples and wrack algal samples was attempted and proved that there exists no significant difference. High cadmium values were shown in Phyllospadix although no known use of this element is known.","208":"Two contrasting beaches characterized by heavy and light wave action showed increasing sand organic carbon content with decreasing tidal height. Sand samples collected when wet and when dry from identical sites showed significant differences in organic carbon content levels. Evidence against the possibility that a greater number of meiofauna was present in the wet sand samples suggest that this difference is due to a direct contribution of organic material from the sea.","209":"Populations of Orchestoidia corniculata, maintained in the laboratory under a variety of unnatural conditions, displayed the same activity pattern as a field population monitored during the same 8 day period. After eight days, the experimental populations began to vary from the natural populations in a way to be expected if the amphipods possessed an endogenous rhythm in phase with the tides.","210":"Some characteristics of suspended particulate matter over two pocket sandy beaches were investigated. The amount of suspended material varied with wave turbulence but differences average out over time. Most particulate matter (80%) was algal detritus. Fifty percent ranged from .45 microns to 500 microns in diameter. A standing pool of littoral particulate matter seems to be maintained, alternating between a suspended and settled state. Availability to biota depends on balance between states.","211":"Although concentrations of heavy and trace metals are not magnified through the studied trophic levels, this possibility may still exist. This is suggested from the high elemental levels observed at Fisherman's Wharf (Cu and Pb), Monterey Sewage Outfall (Ag, Cd, and Zn), and Elkhorn Slough (Fe). These high values, possible consequences of pollution, should not go unchecked. Much study is still needed as to toxicity, base levels, and the possible biological magnification of heavy and trace metals.","212":"1. The mesostigmatid mite, Gammaridacarus brevisternalis has been found and identified on both decomposing beach wrack and on the beach amphipods Orchestoidea corniculata and O. californiana. 2. The percentage of infestation of the host population increases with size of host and varied from 1.5% (hosts 3 - 7.9 mm) to 83.07% (hosts 16 - 19.9 mm). Mites showed no preference for male or female hosts. The number of mites per infested host increases slightly with amphipod size. 3. Mites were found attached, either by mouth parts or posterior end, exclusively on the ventral side. 4. The mites were found to leave dead hosts within 2 - 9 hours after death. 5. Mites without hosts can crawl over sand at an average rate of 3 inches per minute. 6. Gammaridacarus brevisternalis were found, after leaving dead hosts, to attach to new, living hosts. When contact between dead and living hosts was prevented, the mites traveled up to at least 30 cm in finding new hosts. Observations suggest that the mites may posses senses for locating healthy hosts at a distance.","213":"There is evidence to suggest accumulation of nickel in Travisia gigas. Copper is accumulated on Nephtys californiensis, Euzonas mucronata and Nerinides acuta. Accumulation of zinc takes place in N. californiensis, E. dillonensis and N. acuta. Lead accumulation seems to take place in E. mucronata. This study show that zinc and copper are in consistently high levels in the worms as opposed to the sand and this may suggest some use by the worms such as a metallo-enzyme.","214":"An attempt was made to measure microbial activity in beach sand in relation to the black sulfide-containing layer. Three biogeochemical conversions were investigated. Changes in microbial activity as a function of sand depth were observed and found to be primarily correlated with differences in sand color. Conversion rates as determined in the laboratory were found not be good indices of in situ activity. However, since all results were comparative, they were able to give information about general activity distributions. Not only was anaerobic respiration involving sulfide production most pronounced in sands containing high amounts of sulfide, aerobic respiration was also greatest in this type of sand. On the other hand, the most rapid rates for autotrophic conversion of ammonia to nitrite were not associated with sulfide-rich sands.","215":"1. In the field Olivella biplicata exhibit a tendency to be above the sand at night and burrowing under in the sand in direct light. 2. Experiments on locomotor activity in light and darkness suggest a correlation between snail activity and presence on the sand surface, both of which are greater in conditions of darkness. 3. After exposure to normal and inverted 12 hr light:12 hr dark regimes under laboratory conditions, populations of Olivella biplicata exhibited oscillations in activity coinciding with those of controls or former oscillations during entrainment. This suggests the existence of a circadian rhythm.","216":"Microalgal communities occurring on sediments of three beaches on Monterey Bay, California, were studied to determine their relative abundance and distribution. Viable photosynthetic organisms were found at depths to 50cm. Environmental parameters regulating the littoral and vertical biomass of these organisms are discussed.","217":"Counts made from course samples of interstitial meiofauna, taken two weeks apart, at high and low tide each time, on exposed and protected transects of a long beach, indicate that on both transects the meiofauna maintained stable ranges and associations. Meiofauna of both transects included oligochaetes and collembolids on the high beach, harpacticoid copepds on the midbeach, archiannelids on the low beach, and nematodes and turbellarians at all levels. The exposed transect also contained ostracods (midbeach) and nereid polychaetes (low beach). Nematodes predominated numerically at all except the highest and lowest sampling sites. Within their broad ranges the meiofauna were patchily distributed. On the protected transect, each site contained about on equal number of meiofauna. On the exposed beach, meifauna were most abundant at mean high water. Overall meiofaunal distribution correlated neither with macrofaunal distribution, nor with zones of stress associated with surf or tidal action. This, and their patch microdistribution, suggest that meifauna may be distributed according to microhabitat differences as much as by macroscopic influences.","218":"The ability of the isopod Cirolana harfordi to withstand prolonged periods of anoxia (W. Johnson, unpub.) at normal activity levels suggests the presence of an efficiently facultative anaerobic metabolism. The study of oxygen consumption and debt, when compared to declining oxygen tension, leads to a knowledge of lactate production which can be used to predict the nature of aerobic-anaerobic switching setpoints, and to estimate the efficiency of the metabolic pathway beyond lactate. Such knowledge, if later compared with various substrate concentrations produced by oxygen stress, should delineate the entire pathway.","219":"Idotea resecata lives primarily on bay Zostera and Macrocystis and is considered to a typical bay species (Menzies,1950). Idotea montereyensis is adapted to open coast Phyllospadix beds and is considered to be a typical open coast species. Both species have been labeled as lower intertidal forms. Tolerances to heat, salinity, and survival at low oxygen tensions were measured, and morphology of the pereaopods was also examined. It was found that I. montereyensis had longer LT-50's for the higher temperature and salinity stresses, enabling it to cope with both the lower intertidal environment of the Phyllospadix beds and also the higher intertidal tide pools into which it is sometimes washed. I. resecata has slightly greater abilities to deal with low oxygen situations, enabling it to cope with the low oxygen concentrations often found in Zostera beds. The pereaopods of I. montereyensis seem to be more adapted than those of I. resecata to gripping the substrate effectively in heavy wave action on the basis of morphology. Because I. montereyensis migrates vertically as it develops and has the physiological tolerances to cope with the range of environmental parameters associated with such a migration, it is felt that to consider it only a species of the lower intertidal is misleading.","220":"A population of the theridiid spider Steatoda grossa in Pacific Grove, California was studied to observe its predatory behavior towards the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber and subsidiary prey items. The isopod and spider are both found to be nocturnally active. The carcasses of consumed prey are cut from the spider's web to collect in a debris pile which can be examined for an indication of long term dietary consumption. The isopod, though rejected as prey by most spiders because of repugnant tegumental glands, composes 84% of the diet of this spider as determined by web analysis. The spider from laboratory experiments was found to go about five days between meals but able to tolerate periods of three weeks or more without feeding.","221":"Acclimation with respect to temperature is a widespread, species-specific phenomenon, and has been studied extensively by many previous researchers. In my brief study, no significant metabolic rate differences were obtained between Porcellio scaber populations kept at five degrees C, fifteen degrees C, and ambient air temperature for a period of two weeks. No significant differences were found for L. T. 50 measurements either, but due to small sample sizes and a stringent assumption of normality for the analysis used, conclusions cannot be made with any certainty.","222":"1. Newborn Idotea stenops were raised on several diets and their mortality and growth determined. 2. Quantitative feeding experiments were performed on I. stenops using several weight classes. Quantities of food ingested and assimilated were calculated. 3. Phyllospadix was found to have much less food value than the other marine plants tested. Egregia gave the best results in terms of survival and growth of the newborn. Other forms of brown algae approach the food value of Egregia. Other plants tested were the brown algae Laminaria and Pelvetia, and the red alga Iridaea.","223":"The cuticles of four species of isopods, the terrestrial species Armadillidium vulgare and Porcellio scaber, and the marine species Idotea montereyensis and Idotea resecata, were examined, focusing attention on whether or not there is a detectable lipid layer, such as occurs in insects, which might aid in water-proofing the integument of these animals. The rates of water loss over a range of temperatures were compared. A comparison of such rates with those of animals which had been treated with chloroform, a lipid solvent, is presented, and the results suggest that similar methods used in the past may lead to erroneous conclusions. No lipids were detectable in the cuticles with histochemical techniques. Basic structural similarities and differences in the cuticles of the four species are given, and the significance of these results are discussed.","224":"Water and humidity relations are perhaps the most important physical factors affecting populations of Porcellio scaber. Increasing humidity is positively related to increased size and increased population density. Increased water content is negatively related to increased size. As the humidity in a population varies more, the mean size of Porcellio decreases.","225":"Field studies have revealed that female Porcellio scaber seek warmer temperatures than male, this was also confirmed by laboratory experiments. Lab experiments indicated no difference in temperature response between brooding and non-brooding females. It has been show that increasing the temperature of the microhabitat from 15 to 20 degrees C doubles the rate of embryonic development, perhaps explaining the behavior of the females.","226":"The marsupium of the brooding females of Porcellio scaber Latreille contains four soft-walled processes which emerge from the midventral body wall on thoracic segments 3 to 6 inclusive. The processes have been called cotyledons, and their morphology and position have been well documented. The present studies were directed toward extending present knowledge of the distribution of these structures in the Oniscoidea, and gaining further insight into their function.","227":"1. Green canthaxanthin -carotenoproteins were isolated and partially purified from three species of marine idoteid isopods Idotea montereyensis (Maloney), Idotea resecata (Stimpson), and Idotea kerchanskii (Miller and Lee). 2. The proteins have similar absorption maxima at 280nm and 683nm, similar electrophoretic properties, and a molecular weight of greater than 480,000. 3. Although shown not to be lipoproteins, the proteins show both lipophilic and hydrophilic properties. 4. A comparison of canthaxanthin-carotenoproteins and astaxanthin-carotenoproteins is made.","228":"1. An inverse exponential relationship between ammonia excretion as expressed in ng NH3\/mg dry body weight\/hr when plotted as a function of dry body weight (mg) has been established in Cirolana harfordi, a marine isopod. 2. A diurnal pattern of ammonia excretion has been detected in specimens of C. harfordi exposed to a normal light\/dark photoperiod. 3. Non-fed members of a C. harfordi population exhibit a dampened pattern of diurnal ammonia release and appear to excrete less total ammonia per unit tissue weight over a 24-hour period than do fed individuals. 4. Conditions of constant light or constant dark do not remove the observed pattern of diurnal ammonia release. Continuous light dampens the daily excretion rhythm and appears to cause a diminution in ammonia excretion rates observed over a 24-hour period.","229":"C. harfordi shows definite nocturnal activity patterns. Of the four environmental factors examined, light and water depth affect the animals' level of activity. Light is the most important of the two; only in the absence of this factor does water depth appear to influence the activity of the animal.","230":"Mechanical aspects of the movement of food through the digestive system of the marine isopod Idotea resecata were analyzed by means of measuring feeding rates, defecation rates, and the path of dyed food through the digestive tract.","231":"Substrate selection and distribution of the isopod Idothea resecata was studied in relation to Macrocystis kelp beds in Monterey Bay, California. 1. Field studies showed that this isopod prefers floating stipe to other portions of the plant. 2. No animals were found in stipe more than ten feet below the surface, nor on the blades. 3. No correlation was observed between the numbers of isopods and the condition of the alga on which they occurred. 4. I. resecata prefers the outer layers of Nereocystis to the cortex, and to Macrocystis. 5. This isopod prefers Macrocystis to Zostera as a food substrate. 6. The animals may be attracted to Macrocystis and members of their own species by soluble factors.","232":"Populations of P. stenops were observed and sampled along selected areas on the Central California coast. Ecological factors affecting their population distribution as well as characteristic behavior pattern were noted. Lab experiments were performed to test the significance of such observations on the general well-being of the isopod.","233":"This investigation indicated larval L. vulgaris were incapable of sensory perception of host fish without physical contact between isopod and fish. Random activity as a means of infesting flatfish was shown a possibility using behavioral studies in combination with a brief study of flatfish population densities. Infestation by the feeding upon the isopod by fish was shown physically possible, and provided a logical explanation for the occurrence of the parasitic isopod on pelagic fish. Much work remains to be done on this subject.","234":"Diurnal rhythms in ammonia release were studied in the following eight species of isopods found in Monterey, California: Porcellio scaber (Latreille, 1804), Alloniscus perconvexus (Dana, 1854), Armadillidium vulgare (latreille, 1804), Idothea montereyensis (maloney, 1933), Idothea kirchanskii (Lee, 1967), Idothea resecata (Stimpson, 1857), Cirolana harfordi (Lockington, 1877), and Lironeca vulgaris (Stimpson, 1857). All species studied except C. harfordi showed conspicuous peaks of release between noon and 4 pm, and minima at various times during the night. The experiments, carried out on fed male specimens in constant light are believed to represent a general pattern in isopods.","235":"Crude extracts of the hepatopancreas from Armadillidium vulgare and Idothea resecata were investigated for hydrolytic activity using the following substrates: soluble starch, maltose, lactose, melibiose, cellobiose, sucrose, and sodium alginate. Activity with respect to starch, maltose, and sucrose was demonstrated. No activity for lactose, melibiose, cellobiose, or sodium alginate was detected.","236":"1. Chromatophore pigments in the isopod Idotea resecata are dispersed during the day and punctate at night under normal day\/night light condition, in constant darkness, and in constant low intensity light. 2. Under constant strong illumination there is no diurnal rhythm of movement of chromatophore pigments. 3. Under conditions of prolonged constant darkness individual isopods become asynchronous in rhythmic chromatophore changes, and the degree of pigment dispersal and concentration is decreased in some animals. 4. The degree of expansion or contraction of chromatophores depends on both background color and light intensity. 5. Rates of change in chromatophores accompanying changes in background color are constant at all times of the day or night. 6. After constant strong illumination for 48 hours on a black background, the rate at which isopods adapted to a white background was decreased, while the accompanying switch from white to black was unchanged.","237":"An attempt was made to determine the distributional limits and zonation of several species of isopods on a sand beach at Hopkins Marine Station, Monterey, California.","238":"1. Field studies have indicated that Alloniscus perconvexus, the sand beach isopod, exhibits a definite pattern of nocturnal activity, with peak activity between 2200 and 0200. 2. Laboratory studies indicated that A. perconvexus demonstrates a positive phototropic response when threatened by desiccation. 3. Strong evidence was found for the existence of an endogenous rhythm in A. perconvexus which is in synchrony with the natural light-dark cycle. This rhythm seems to determine the activity patterns of the animal. This is a powerful rhythm, for after 7 days of entrainment to a reversed light regime, the activity pattern of a population of A. perconvexus shift within 3 days to that pattern associated with a normal light cycle once the population was placed into constant darkness.","239":"During a 23 day period after feeding with dyed food, gut contents and morphology of C. harfordi were monitored. Food in the hindgut, in changing volumes of fluid, was broken down into small pieces and eventually digested. The midgut gland showed a continual presence of fat droplets and fluids and contained patches of the dyed food cells. The dye used did not stain the tissue of the hindgut which became clear as the hindgut emptied. The gut diameter increased after feeding and gradually narrowed. Changes in the relative positions of the diverticula were noted. Overall lipid contents increased sharply with feeding and remained at higher levels than those in non-fed animals through-out the period, indicating that starvation was not occurring.","240":"The marine isopod Idotea resecata is found on the brown kelp, Macrocystis. The utilization of selected appendages of I. resecata was studied. The second antennae probe the environment and may be used in feeding in conjunction with the first peraeopods. They act as pivot points in righting and in alighting on kelp while swimming. The first peraeopods are used in grooming the second antennae in a manner suggesting a feeding mechanism. They are associated with the mouth parts and are used for locomotion only in compensation behavior. The second, third, and fourth peraeopods are oriented forward. Along with the fifth pair, they are the main ambulatory legs. The first three peraeopods are used for grabbing kelp when the animal is swimming. The last three peraeopods are used for gripping the substrate and are used as water brakes in swimming behavior. They are also used for removing the anterior molt. The uropods direct water flow through the pleotelson. The pleopods show functional differentiation. The first two pleopods posses hairs and are natatory. The fourth and fifth pleopods are probably used mainly for respiration. The correlation between the rate that the pleopods beat and the rate of heart beat suggest that the pleopods play a role in circulation. Observations on regeneration were done.","241":"Embryos were removed from the marsupia of ovigerous females of Idotea stenops and examined for developmental stage and total number present. Statistical analyses suggest that body length of females and embryonic stage of young both influence fecundity, body length contributing positively and developmental stage contributing negatively. Embryos at different stages of development were observed in the brood pouches of only a few individuals. Juvenile isopods were found to inhabit only the brown algal Egregia menziesii while adults inhabited both Egregia and Laminaria setcheilli. The relative size and number of isopods decreased with increasing tidal height. Juvenile isopods comprise the bulk of the population in all study areas.","242":"Dissections and drawings were made of the testes and endopodites of eight species of California isopods. The Oniscoidea represented by Alloniscus perconvexus, Armadillidium vulgare, Ligia occidentalis, and Porcellio scaber have three uniformly spaced, elongate testes attached to a seminal vesicle at various positions in the body cavity. All but L. occidentalis have a broad projection from the first endopodite and a sickle-like style from the second endopodite. The Valvifera are represented by Idothea (Pentidotea) resicata and I. stenops. Both of these species have similar elongate testes spread down a thin vas deferens. There are no special modifications of the first endopodites in either species and the second endopodites have a long uniformly wide style. The Flabellifera also show similarities within the suborder. Cirolana harfordi and small Lironeca vulgaris both have bulbous, sac-like testes extending from the apex of a narrow vas deferens which may take many different paths in C. harfordi. The larger L. vulgaris has only an amorphous mass of tissue for testes as it begins its transformation to a female. All three forms have similar tapering styles on the second endoporite.","243":"An energetics study was carried out on the marine kelp bed isopod Idothea resecata. An assimilation efficiency of 0.71 was found for animals living on a diet of Macrocystis pyrifera.","244":"1. Scratching by chickens in feeding causes Armadillidium vulgare to roll up. 2. Chickens eat Armadillidium that are active more than rolled or dead ones.","245":"A study of the attachment of the Livoneca vulgaris to its hosts, Citharichthys sordidus and Platichthys stellatus, showed that their charateristic orientation is with the head in the anterior part of the gill chamber, pointed toward the anterior of the host and its dorsal surface lies against the outer flap of the chamber. A parasitized gill chamber may be missing gill filaments or have an indentation on the inner side as a result of the female's swollen brood pouch. Livoneca's diet is fish blood which it stores in its diverticula.","246":"Evidence suggests that developing embryos increase in both inorganic and organic weight within the brood pouch. Brood fluid appears to contain a higher concentration of solute than other fluids found in the animals' environment. Several hypotheses can be developed to describe these results: a) the mother is actively concentrating minerals and\/or nutrients within the brood fluid; b) a decrease in brood size is noted through development. Perhaps decaying embryos provide and important source for other developing embryos. More work is needed to concretely say if the mother is actively supplying minerals and\/or nutrients to developing embryos. The evidence I have presented is circumstantial but highly suggestive that indeed the mother is active in embryonic development.","247":"The habitats of 12 intertidal chitons from six sites on the Monterey Peninsula in central California picked for variability in surf exposure and substrate type, were described in terms of physical factors and biological associates. The Chitons were Cryptochiton stelleri, Cyanoplax hartwegii, Ischnochiton regularis, Katharina tunicata, Mopalia ciliata, Mopalia hindsii, Mopalia lignosa, Mopalia muscosa, Nuttallina californica, Placiphorella velata, Stenoplax heathiana, and Tonicella lineata. The most important environmental parameters in determining chiton habitats proved to be surf strength, light exposure, substrate composition, moisture and biological associates.","248":"The chiton Stenoplax heathiana was shown to respond to both the onset (on-response) and the removal (off-response) of the light stimulus. In both cases the response consisted of a slight clamp-down to the substrate, presumably to help maintain the animals grip on the substrate. If the animal is light adapted, the magnitude of the off-response increases while that of the on-response decreases. These responses were shown to be independent of the wavelength of the light used to light adapt the animal, which indicates that the differences did not result from stimulating two separate visual pigments. Thus, while this effect has clear adaptive significance","249":"Niche partitioning by the chitons Cyanoplax hartwegii and Mopalia muscosa, and the limpets Collisella limatula and Collisella pelta, two classes of molluscs with similar functions in the intertidal community, under the brown alga Pelvetia fastigiata was studied. Cyanoplax and Mopalia were found to partition a common habitat by different micro habitat preferences and behavioral patterns. Food niche overlap with C. pelta was lessened by Mopalia's aggressive behavior. Food niche overlap with C. limatula and resting area overlap with C. pelta were lessened by Cyanoplax's nomadic behavior.","250":"According to both the experiments and field observations, potential predators on Cyanoplax hartwegii are ranked as follows: Leptasterias pusilla (on chitons 1 cm), Pisaster ochraceus >>> Pachygrapsus crassipes (occasional), Hemigrapsus nudus (occasional). The algal covering of Pelvetia fastigiata is a protective barrier from predation against Pisaster ochraceus, and possibly from birds; all the other potential predators tested showed no preference for chitons on bare rocks as opposed to those covered by Pelvetia.","251":"1. Tonicella lineata characteristically occurs on a coralline algal substratum. 2. Coralline algae comprise an average of more than 50% of its diet. 3. Subtidally, Tonicella lineata exhibits increased activity nocturnally. Intertidally, heightened activity coincides with periods of high water. 4. Indications of homing behavior were observed in some intertidal and subtidal individuals. 5. Intertidal and subtidal populations of Tonicella lineata differ in body size, color, activity pattern, and number of valve notches.","252":"Mopalia lignosa on the Monterey Peninsula appear to be herbivores; an average of 68% of the gut contents is of plant origin, consisting principally (11-20%) of green algae (Ulva spp.) and several species of diatoms, with a variety of other algal species in smaller amounts. Small plant particles in the small and large intestine were without pigment or protoplasm, only the cell walls remaining. On the other hand, if pieces were large, they were often passed through the gut unchanged in color or cell shape. Animal material found in the gut consisted of small crustacea, or fragments of them, foraminifera and bryozoans of sizes and shapes suggestive of inadvertent feeding. These never averaged more than 3.3% of the bulk of the total contents. Full stomachs in freshly dissected chitons and trails of fecal pellets upon collection of these animals suggests early morning or nocturnal feeding.","253":"1. Cyanoplax dentiens was found underneath Nuttalina californica, along its pallial groove. 2. The association was restricted primarily to those Nuttalina on a shady vertical or angled rock face in the mid-zone of the Nuttalina range. 3. C. detiens appeared to be negatively phototoxic. 4. C. dentiens possibly uses Nuttalina as its microhabitat for purposes of protection against desiccation, harsh sunlight, predators, etc. 5. C. dentiens was found capable of detecting and seeking out Nuttalina californica.","254":"Electrophysiological data were gathered on an isolated segment of the somatic musculature of Cryptochiton stelleri, a subtidal Polyplacophoran. 1. The muscles were found to be iterative, single stimuli evoking no response. 2. Both steady D.C. (2 sec.) and trains of short duration pulses evoke a short-term \"phasic\" response, although the time relationships differ slightly. 3. Steady D.C. of polarity opposite to the above yields a longer \"tonic\" response. 4. Both the tonic and phasic contractions will summate, but only the phasic will sustain a state of tetanus. 5. The tonic response is hypothetically attributed to membrane hyperpolarization and subsequent Ca++ influx, and as such, probably does not occur in vivo.","255":"1. Two vertically separated populations of Tonicella lineata (Wood, 1815) were tested for acute and acclimated respiratory rates at a series of five temperatures. 2. Tonicella show no diurnal or tidal rhythm in respiratory rate. 3. Q10 seems unaffected by body weight in both populations. 4. Subtidal Tonicella are not acclimated in the field to a colder temperature than are intertidal Tonicella but may be less able to compensate for temperature change. 5. Intertidal Tonicella show a pattern of acclimation after three weeks in the laboratory; results from subtidal animals are ambiguous.","256":"1. Mopalia lignosa respire at a higher rate as the temperature increases. 2. Deviation in salinity from normal sea water causes a decrease in respiratory rate. 3. At low, but not higher temperatures, the Q10 increases with salinity.","257":"1. The lateral force required to dislodge the chitons Mopalia lignosa, Mopalia muscosa, Nuttalina californica, Katharina tunicata, and Stenoplax heathiana was directly related to the degree of exposure to wave action in the habitat of each species. 2. The rougher the surface to which a chiton was attached, the greater the force required to remove the specimens from the surface. 3. The foot plays the major role in attachment by secreting an adhesive mucus material and by mechanically conforming to surface irregularities with its tissue. 4. Suction does not appear to play a major role in the attachment of species tested.","258":"1. The chiton Cyanoplax hartwegii found on Mussel Point in Pacific Grove, California under the brown alga Pelvetia fastigiata, is more active at night and is negatively phototactic in the lab. Protection afforded by the Pelvetia habitat might explain the considerable daytime activity that does occur. 2. The tidal cycle affects the animals' activity, greatest activity occurring at dry and awash periods. Lesser activity during the high tides may be due to the strength of the surge or to the difficulty in feeding on Pelvetia during these times. 3. Although strict homing is not exhibited by C. hartwegii, certain \"campsites\" on the substratum are occupied successively by different individuals. This behavior may have survival value as these sites may be consistently well-protected spots.","259":"The small intertidal chiton Cyanoplax hartwegii (Carpenter, 1855) was found to be an osmoconformer over the range 75% to 125% of normal sea water using body fluid freezing point depression and body weight changes. The initial rapid weight change was subsequently reduced by volume regulation. After 24 hours of exposure at 13.5 degrees C all animals survived and had returned to within a few percent of initial weight. No behavioral modifications were noted: Animals remained attached, moved and did not clamp down. Its ability to withstand salinity fluctuations and to rapidly volume regulate are important adaptations of Cyanoplax hartwegii to the middle and high intertidal zones.","260":"The blood glucose concentration of Cryptochiton stelleri was found to be 3.5 +\/- 2.0 mg % with no significant difference between the sexes. The chitons were observed to rapidly counteract increases in their blood sugar brought about by glucose injection. In an attempt to elucidate the regulatory mechanism involved in maintaining Cryptochiton's relatively constant blood sugar concentration, the effect of infusing vertebrate insulin, norepinephrine, and serotonin was monitored. None of the hormones used appeared to have any affect on the chiton's blood sugar concentration.","261":"In a study of contents of the western gulls' regurgitation pellets, Pollicipes polymerus, the gooseneck barnacle, was shown to be the most abundant material. The chiton Nuttalina californica was also found to occur in the pellets in relatively high frequency, indicating that the western gull is a major predator on Nuttalina, perhaps taking 15% of the population around the study site per breeding season.","262":"Since the diet of N. californica indicates feeding by grazing on larger algae, and these are not available within deep depressions in the Dodecaceria bed, feeding activity must occur when the animals emerge from their shelters at high tide. Preliminary studies support this hypothesis. Numerous Nuttalina were observed crawling out of their depressions when the bed was awash on an incoming tide; however, further studies need to be done in order to determine whether this movement is correlated with feeding activity.","263":"1. The concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in the blood of Nuttalina californica were measured and show the typical molluscan trend. 2. Over a range of experimental salinities from 50 to 150% sea water, the blood values of sodium and magnesium were the same as the same ions in sea water, while blood potassium and calcium levels were higher, possibly by active regulation. 3. The rate of flux was greater in 50 than in 150% sea water for all ions; the rate series appears to be K+ > Na+, Ca2+ > Mg2+ 4. In exposed animals, sodium and calcium were held constant. Potassium was initially lowered, magnesium raised; these changes may be correlated with an observed lowering of metabolism on exposure to air.","264":"1. Stomach contents were examined in 65 specimens of Cyanoplax hartwegii taken from three different intertidal microhabitats near Monterey, California. 2. In the Pelvetia bed habitat, Pelvetia made up 80% of the total diet, while in the higher crevice habitat, the algae Hildenbrandia, Endocladia, Petrocelis, and Cladophora spp. comprised 90% of the diet and were eaten in relatively equal amounts. 3. In the high tidepool habitat, C. hartwegii ate a much wider variety of algae. Gigartina and Hildenbradia together made up 40% of the diet. Crustose corallines and Gigartina occurred in all habitats examined, but were eaten by Cyanoplax only in the tidepools.","265":"The respiratory anatomy and function of intertidal Nuttallina californica and subtidal Tonicella lineata were compared in an attempt to elucidate adaptations of the former to frequent aerial exposure. Though Nuttallina has not apparently adapted for increased efficiency of air breathing, studies of recovery from extended periods of exposure have indicated a probable oxygen debt present in Tonicella and absent in Nuttallina. Field and laboratory observations suggest that Nuttallina decreases its metabolic activity when uncovered. However, further work is necessary to confirm these conclusions and to elucidate the physiological basis of Nuttallina's resistance to oxygen debt during periods of exposure.","266":"1. The uptake of D-glucose and D-galactose by the intestine of Cryptochiton stelleri (Middendorff, 1846) was studied in vitro by the accumulation of sugar within intestinal tissue. 2. Proximal anterior intestinal tissue actively absorbs D-glucose. 3. Proximal posterior intestinal tissue actively absorbs D-glucose and D-galactose, via a separate transport system. 4. The posterior intestinal D-glucose transport system is apparently incapable of transporting 3-0-methylglucose, a non-metabolizable glucose analogue in other transport systems. 5. D-galactose uptake by the posterior intestine is very slow in mammalian terms (Vmax = 0.81 mN\/hr), although the D-galactose transport system of Cryptochiton stelleri shows a greater sensitivity (Km = 0.1mM) to D-galactose than does the equivalent system in hamster intestine. This indicates a slow but efficient accumulation of D-galactose at low concentrations by this invertebrate.","267":"There appears to be relatively little predation upon subtidal Tonicella lineata at Mussel Point, California, and there is significant discrimination against feeding on them in the laboratory. A chemical repellent, or some kind of tactile inhibitor of predation are deemed possible explanations. The mechanism of the protection against predation is not known, but appears to be associated with the dorsal surface of living animals.","268":"1. High intertidal Nutallina californica can cope with osmotic stress better than the low intertidal chitons as shown by their smaller weight change. 2. The low intertidal chitons have a slower initial rate of weight loss in hypertonic seawater. 3. Attached and unattached animals reach the same equilibrium point so behavior alone can't explain the differences in osmotic response. 4. There is a large deviation from predicted weight changes in 50% and 75% seawater which shows that both populations do exhibit some regulation, but with a difference in effectiveness.","269":"The study carried out on Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846) was directed toward revealing its temporal and spatial patterns of activity. Attention was also focused on inter- and intraspecific interactions involved in habitat partitioning, and on the possible occurrence of individual home sites and territories or home ranges.","270":"Analysis was done on the foot, gut, digestive gland, and gonad using the methanol-ethyl method for lipids and phenol-sulfuric acid method for glycogen. Species differences were found only in the foot tissues. Female Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846) had a lower percentage of lipid in the foot tissue than did female Nuttallina californica (Reeve, 1847). Comparing both sexes, N. muscosa was found to have a higher level of glycogen in the foot tissue than N. californica. In the tissues of both species studied lipids are quantitatively the more important storage materials.","271":"Spawning behavior and external features of the larval development were studied in the chitons Mopalia muscosa and M. lignosa during the months of April-June, 1974, at Pacific Grove, California. The sequence of events in the development of the two species in the same, though some differences in timing exist.","272":"Under high intensity fluorescent light, the intertidal chiton, Mopalia muscosa was shown to be negatively phototactic when left 4.5 to 27 hours. Chitons seemed to respond to tide both exogenously and endogenously by reduction of movement. The suggested tidal rhythm appears to be the mechanism by which these chitons may predict the heights of low tides. The rhythm appears to have been rephased by a single artificial low tide of 10 to 45 minutes. Diurnal movement patterns appear to be exogenous.","273":"A study was undertaken to identify the nitrogenous waste products released from the intertidal chiton Mopalia muscosa (Gould, 1846). The Solorzano method was used to test for the presence of ammonia and\/or urea, while nihydrin positive nitrogenous compounds were identified by the Spies method. Large variability within each sample collected from each of five chitons did not allow a significant comparison between levels of ammonia and urea, although both nitrogenous compounds were present. However, in three of the M. muscosa high levels in ninhydrin positive material were found in comparison to the ammonia and urea levels. For one chiton these levels were 220.4 +\/- 27.2 ug of ninhydrin positive nitrogen, 42.2 +\/- 4.7 ug of urea nitrogen, and 51.4 +\/- 12.0 ug of ammonia nitrogen. The ninhydrin positive nitrogen was released from this M. muscosa at a rate of 0.48mg\/100g\/day.","274":"The hermit crab Pagurus samuelis is able to develop a relationship with the sea anemones Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica such that the crab is able to interact with the column, tentacles and oral disc of the anemone without being stung by the nematocysts. The crab steals the anemone's food from its gastric cavity, picks up detritus from the column and tentacles, and eats either anemone tissue or mucus. The protection against nematocysts is probably due to the acquisition of anemone mucus on the crab's appendages so that the anemone responds to the crab as it would respond to its own tissue.","275":"The sea anemones Anthopleura elegantissma, Metridium senile, and Corynactis californica are observed to engage in interspecific aggression. This aggressive behavior is elicited only thru tentacle contact. The receptors that detect interspecific antagonists are located only on the tentacle tips in Anthopleura and Metridium, while Corynactis detects from the sides of its tentacles. Each species of anemone exhibits an aggressive behavioral pattern peculiar to its own species.","276":"The behavioral interactions between copepods and six species of anemones (Telia lofotensis, T. crassicornis, T. coriacea, Anthopleura elegantissima, A. xanthogrammica, and Epiactis prolifera) were examined. Lab and field studies over a six week period showed that the copepods feed on anemone mucus and are dependent on the anemone for survival. Mature copepods were found to inhabit anemone species specifically. It was also found that copepods showed species specific zonation on the anemone; occupying areas where their color matched that of the anemone. Adult copepods failed to visually or chemically cue to anemones.","277":"1. Four factors possibly aid attachment of Anthopleura elegantissima: Nematocysts, Substrate Conformation, Suction, and Adhesion. 2. The pedal disc mucus is significantly more cohesive a substance than sea water. 3. Optimal spacing of the pedal disc and mucus in substrate conformation and adhesion may play a dominant role in attachment. 4. Large scale suction involving the pedal disc acting as a single raised cup does not occur. 5. The paucity of nematocysts in the pedal disc suggest that their role in the attachment can only be minor. 6. The chemical composition of the substrate may be involved in preferential attachment.","278":"Oxygen respirometry proved to be a useful means of evaluation for the effects of glycerol on the cells of Anthopleura xanthogrammica. The utilization of glycerol was demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively. An experiment using (U-14C) glycerol did not show evidence for direct or inductive utilization of glycerol. Comparisons made with A. elegantissima using data from similar experiments performed by Harvie indicated that the role of glycerol in both Anthopleura was similar.","279":"Anthopleura elegantissima was tested for phototaxis and possible photosynthetic products responsible for such behavior. Anemones, symbiotic with zooxanthellae, show phototactic responses. Phototaxis can be disrupted by exposing anemones to oxygen contents higher than ambient. Directional movement is induced by exposing opposite sides of an anemone to different oxygen concentrations; the anemone moves towards the side of higher oxygen content. Aposymbiotic clones of A. elegantissima show significantly more spacing between individuals than symbiotic clones. Symbiotic clones under oxygen stress show spacing similar to aposymbiotic clones. There is a direct relationship between distribution of clonal individuals and oxygen availability, either from the environment or from endosymbionts.","280":"Different areas of anemone were found to have different relative amounts of chlorophyll-a, and differential apparent division rates of zooxanthellae. Pheophytin-a was used as an assay of compounds released to anemone tissue due to zooxanthellae degeneration. Pheophytin appears to be periodically accumulated in the anemone tissue, indicating a possible use of chloroplastic material from lysed cells as a nutritional source.","281":"The present investigation was conducted to determine how the anemones attract gravel to the themselves, and to ascertain the relation between the availability of gravel and the amount of gravel actually attached to anemones.","282":"Using the amount of Chlorophyll A as an indicator of numbers of zooxanthellae (Dinoflagellata) present per gram tentacle of Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica, it was found that the amount decreased with subtidal depth. The scarcity of Anthopleura below 40 feet depth appears not to be dependent on the availability of light, but on other unknown factors.","283":"Measurements obtained by the direct method of Warburg definitely show that glycerol has an effect on the oxygen consumption of a whole cell preparation of Anthopleura elegantissima. However, inconclusive evidence from the utilization of U-14C glycerol has not shown whether glycerol is directly metabolized or inductively used by A. elegantissima cells. A comparison with other results for a similar investigation with A. xanthogrammica, shows that whole cell preparations of both A. elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica react in the same manner to glycerol.","284":"1. Fed specimens of the sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima, excrete more ammonia than starved specimens, suggesting that A. elegantissima is ammonotelic as expected. 2. Preliminary findings suggest that the endosymbiotic zooxanthellae present in A. elegantissima take up ammonia excreted by the animal. 3. Two steps leading to the excretion of ammonia in A. elegantissima are catalyzed by an L-alanine amidotransferase coupled with a glutamic de-hydrogenase. 4. The level of ammonia released during the course of the L-alanine amidotransferase reaction reaches a maximum at 15 minutes at a rate of 0.13 ug NH3\/minute, and thereafter decreases sharply at a rate of 0.04 ug NH3\/minute. This decrease cannot be attributed to a glutamine synthetase reaction.","285":"1. C14O2 and C14 -glycine are both incorporated into the free amino acids of Anthopleura elegantissima and its zooxanthellae. 2. C14 is incorporated in greater concentration by zooxanthellae than by Anthopleura elegantissima.","286":"Nine anemone species were found, including two (Cnidopus ritteri (Torrey, 1902), and Diadumine lighti (Hand, 1955)), previously not reported for this area. Hand (1954), reports finding three additional species in this area: Halcampa decemtentaculata (Hand, 1954, \"Carmel\"), Metridium exilis (Hand, 1955, \"Carmel Cove\"), and Telia crassicornis (Mueller, 1776, \"As far south as Carmel\"). I was unable to find these species at my study sites. The effects of other animal species on anemone distribution in the intertidal are not well understood. The Nuttalina californica\/Anthopleura elegantissima interaction provides a relationship future investigators may wish to utilize in the study of biological interaction.","287":"A toxin from the nematocysts of the sea anemone Tealia crassicornis has been partially purified. The toxin is nondialyzable, of molecular weight greater than 3500, and is heat labile, i.e. inactivated after heating for 30 minutes at 100 degrees C. The LD50 is estimated to be the toxin from 2.3 X 10^6 nematocysts per kg of the crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes. This corresponded to 3.68mg of protein per kg of crab.","288":"1. Metridium senile incorporated between 30% and 60% of the C14-labeled glysine, valine, glutamic acid, lysine, and an algal mixture when they were present at natural concentrations. 2. 33% of the glysine and 66% of the glutamic acid incorporated by the anemone was metabolized to CO2. This could account for 12% to 24% of the animal's total CO2 production. 3. The rates of release for glysine and glutamic acid are calculated. There is a net loss of glysine and a net uptake of glutamic acid by the anemone. 4. In starved versus fed anemones, the starved animals take up glysine and produce 14CO2 in significantly higher amounts. The advantage of this to Metridium senile is discussed.","289":"1. Studies were made of the feeding mechanisms and sources of food in natural populations of small and large Metridium senile on wharf pilings in Monterey, California during April and May, 1975. 2. Artemia larvae and adults, the copepod Tigriopus, and squid and Mytilus pieces produced different responses in the small and large anemones when dispensed to tentacles at various distances from the mouth. Small Metridium (3-15 cm in column height) captured food larger than 1mm, the number of tentacles and portion of the oral disc involved increasing with increased size and activity of the prey. Large metridium (20-35 cm in column height) captured Artemia larvae and Tigriopus and held them in the tentacles, closing completely later. Larger prey required more time and tentacular movement to be transferred to the mouth. The large Metridium seem ideally adapted for capture of numerous planktonic organisms and the small anemones seem better suited to larger prey in relation to their body size.","290":"Consistent differences in aggressive behavior were found among four distinct genotypes of Anthopleura elegantissima. These differences could not be attributed to dissimilar weight, tentacle length, or recent past history. Experimental observations indicate that one large A. elegantissima is more effective in defending its space against small nonclonemates than a single A. elegantissima of a size similar to its opponents.","291":"Epitonium tinctum and E. indianorum are two mesogastropods which feed predominantly on the tentacles of various anemones. Laboratory experiments show that they may locate anemones using a chemosensory method. Both produce a purple dye, which may be a carotenoid; and both produce a toxin or anesthetic which is either a large molecule or is attached to a large molecule. The toxin inhibits the compound action potential of the sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens and also the contractions of tentacle from Tealia crassicornis.","292":"There is a large variation in oxygen consumption rates for both Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica. Aerial respiration was found to be two to three times greater than submerged respiration for both species. A b value found for A. elegantissima was calculated to be 0.20. This is quite different from b values for other anemones and other intertidal invertebrates, but seems expected.","293":"Studies were conducted at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California to determine what benefits the externally brooded young may derive from their parents.","294":"1. Anthopleura xanthogrammica, in an unstimulated state, maintains a positive coelenteric pressure whose mean is 10.0 mm of sea water (n=13). In response to prodding a maximum pressure of 30 mm of sea water was measured. The high maintained pressure, relative to that of Metridium senile, may have adaptive significance. 2. Rhythmic oscillations of flow have been observed. Evidence indicates that deflation is muscularly controlled and inflation is not. 3. Evidence suggests that a pressure is important for particular positional configuration and that there is some regulatory mechanism, perhaps stretch of pressure receptors in the body wall. 4. There is transport (not simple diffusion) of tritiated water through the body wall into the coelenteron. Possibilities of sodium and\/or water pumps exist. Transport of water through the body wall challenges present theory of anemone hydrodynamics. 5. A final theory of water movement through the body wall is presently not submittable because of conflicting results of movement of tritiated and non-tritiated water.","295":"Metridium senile taken from natural environments show no significant differences between animals in free amino acid pool concentrations. Gastrodermal tissue of M. senile has a significantly higher free amino acid pool concentration than does tentacular tissue which has a higher concentration than either muscular or ectodermal tissue which have similar concentrations. Fed M. senile show higher intracellular free amino acid concentrations than do starved M. senile. Free amino acid pool concentrations in M. senile vary in direct proportion to the salinity of the surrounding medium.","296":"Clonal and solitary forms of A. elegantissima were comparatively studied and found to have differences in isozyme activity, frequencies in nematocyst types and intertidal location. These differences suggested that food availability was the determining factor in the distribution and expression of the two forms.","297":"1. There are two distinct types of stimulus site: one which responds to two pulses at low voltage, termed ideal, and the other which requires more pulses at higher voltage, termed non-ideal. 2. Stimulation at any site decrements the ability of the site to respond to further stimulation. 3. Nerve net initiated contractions may be differentiated from electrically initiated contractions. 4. Tetrodotoxin has no effect on the responses of Metridium senile to electrical stimulation. 5. Calcium-free sea water extinguishes response to electrical stimulation. 6. The presence of other divalent cations which are believed to compete with calcium extinguishes response. 7. It is theorized that calcium is the spike ion in the nervous system of M. senile.","298":"1. Nerinides acuta is an efficient burrower, building semi-permanent vertical burrows in the sand using its acutely pointed prostomium, while secreting a mucous layer along the anterior third of the body. 2. N. acuta is a non-selective herbivore feeding with its tentacular palps by grabbing food and bringing it to its mouth. It feeds on the plant material washed up on the beach, and moved to the worm by wave action. 3. N. acuta appears capable of breaking down cellulose. 4. The population of N. acuta studied inhabits a narrow tidal range in very dense clusters. 5. It has definite lower and upper limits to its distribution. The upper limit is likely determined by physical factors of water coverage while it is speculated that predators determine the lower limit.","299":"Pherusa papillata is a sand-dweller inhabiting a U-shaped burrow. It is a surface deposit feeder ingesting inorganic and detrital matter. Sand particles are picked up and sorted by two highly mobile palps. Muscular lips shovel in the particles brought to it by the palps. The highly modified anterior setae of the first three setigerous segments create a protective cage within which, when open, the retractile head lies. The setae form a grid due to a mesh created by the specific arrangement of the setae, which is effective in keeping sand particles from entering the enclosed cavity. The grid adjusts to different sand sizes, preventing sand from entering and disrupting the strong ciliary currents of the head which are important for feeding and respiration. When the head is retracted the setae close tightly acting as an operculum and protecting the anterior end.","300":"1. Ophelia assimilis is a sand-feeder deriving a large part of its nutritional requirements from organic material adsorbed to sand grains, and seemingly little else. 2. The worms select for particle size of sand grains when feeding and appear to distinguish and select sand grains containing adsorbed organic material. 3. O. assimilis lives in relatively clean sand with low organic carbon levels. 4. The food substrate contains proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, with protein constituting the bulk of the organic material, and probably providing the most important nutritional contribution. 5. Transit time for normal substrate is about 46 minutes, with rate determinations varying as nutritional constitution of the substrate is varied. 6. The worms do not feed readily on a substrate lacking absorbed nutrients, implying substrate selectivity. 7. Defecation is observed only during feeding.","301":"Phyllochaetopterus prolifica (Chaetoperidae) is a sedentary polychaete occurring in dense colonies of highly branched tubes (Potts, 1914). Like other Chaetopteridae its body is divided into three distinct and highly differentiated regions. This paper investigates various aspects of the biology of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica: its methods of tube irrigation and feeding, the functional morphology of the palps, its methods of asexual reproduction and regeneration, and aspects of its sexual forms.","302":"Dodecaceria fewkesi, a small cirratulid polychate, inhabits environments ranging from the mid-intertidal to subtidal depths of at least 90 feet. This study was undertaken to compare both physiologically, but with emphasis on respiration, and morphologically, D. fewkesi from various habitats. The following characteristics were looked at: 1) Morphology and size of the animals, the pattern of tube construction, and mineral composition of the tubes; 2) Heat stress tolerance; 3) Respiratory rate \/ temperature curves and the Q10 values for these; and 4) Acclimation to experimental temperature regimes as measured by respiratory rate.","303":"Pigmentation in the polychaete worm Nereis grubei has two components. The dark green bile pigment biliverdin occurs in granules in the body wall and in the coelom. An unidentified blue-green pigment was found in the body wall and in oocytes of spawning females. Protective coloration is enhanced by both biliverdin and the unknown pigment. Structural differences appear to be responsible for the color change during oocyte maturation in Nereis grubei.","304":"The regenerative capabilities of Dorvillea moniloceras were investigated in order to answer the following three questions. Can both posterior and anterior regeneration take place? What events take place before full regeneration is attained? Does the position along the body at which a worm is cut affect either the ability to regenerate or the rate of regeneration?","305":"Respiratory rates of the common California intertidal polychaete Dodecaceria fewkesi were measured under different experimental conditions using Warburg constant-volume respirometry. At a constant temperature of 19 C, mean respiratory rates ranged from 69.08 to 648.61 ul O2\/gram worm\/ hour (wet weight), depending upon the environmental conditions. No significant difference was found between the rates in and out of their natural tubes in water, whereas in air the respiratory rates was higher out of their tubes. Respiratory rates in water were significantly higher than those in air under all conditions. Headless worms had a much higher respiratory rate than whole worms.","306":"Orbinia johnsoni were studied from a small sandy beach near Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California, where they are most abundant at low tide levels in fine sand. They were found to have a mean length of 190 mm. The orbiniids were found with their guts the fullest during incoming to high tides. It is plausible that this is when they are feeding. It takes about 3 to 3.5 hours for food to travel through the length of the gut. The orbiniids eat 93 percent sand and 7% organic detritus. Special note should be taken that some food selectivity appears to be involved and that high percentages of organic matter in the feces are found in worms collected during low, outgoing tides. Evidence suggests that the worms are bottom feeders, not coming to the surface to feed.","307":"1. 10-63% of all specimens of the species Eumida bifoliata (fam. Phyllodocidae) in a colony of Phyllochaetopterus prolifica were found inhabiting Phyllochaetopterus tubes or portions thereof. 2. Another phyllodocid, Eulalia avisuliseta, was also found inhabiting Phyllochaetopterus tubes. 3. Eumida bifoliata was the most abundant phyllodocid and its behavior was observed among Phyllochaetopterus tubes as well as inside glass, plastic, and natural tubes. 4. Worms irrigated the tubes and deposited mucus which appeared to be employed in filter-feeding.","308":"The settling behavior of spirobid polychaete larvae from rocky intertidal habitats on Monterey Peninsula was described, and settling of larvae from mixed populations was shown to be promoted by the presence of a suitable substrate bearing a film of microorganisms. At least four species occupy rocks and shells in these areas including Pileolaria sensu and possibly Paradexiospira vitrea and Spirobis marioni.","309":"1. The Dodecaceria collected at five various habitats varied in appearance yet none of these variations indicated certain genetic isolation over environmental effects. 2. Habitat may play the significant role in colonial morphology, with surge possibly being a key factor. 3. No individual morphological evidence was found to support a single or multiple species as within colony variation is adequate to form a continuum of values if all populations are treated as one. 4. Tube extending is identical between Intertidal and Deep Reef populations in the lab. 5. All populations tested were well adapted to handle any naturally occurring osmotic stress. 6. Dodecaceria can live for more than eight days in reduced O2 tension of 0.3 ml\/liter. 7. Temperature must be extreme to be lethal as even at 31 C a time interval of over six hours was needed to cause death to the worms.","310":"Through the use of two bio-assays, fourteen species of polychaetes were evaluated for antibacterial and lysozyme activity. The assays were performed against four species of test bacteria, Microccuss lysodeikticus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseduomonas florescens. Two species of polychaete, Cirriformia spirabrancha and Halosydna brevisetosa, were found to have activity over the full range of test microbes. Two more species, Dodecaceria fewkesi and Nerinides acuta, exhibited action against all but Escherichia coli. The remaining ten polychaetes, Myxicola infundibulum, Megalomma splendida, Arabella iricolor, Lumbrineris zonata, Arenicola cristata, Neoamphitrite robusta, Phyllochaetopterus prolifica, Dorvillea moniloceras, Orbinia johnsoni, Ophidromus pugettensis, and Nereis grubei, evidenced activity ranging from none to positive results against two species of test bacteria. One polychaete, A. cristata, was found to contain a lytic agent similar to the Lysozyme present in Chicken's egg white, and present in higher concentrations.","311":"1. Colonies of Phragmatopoma californica rebuilt their flares in the same direction if unmoved. 2. Colonies of P. californica were observed to occasionally change the orientation of their flares in the field. 3. It appeared that currents may dictate flare construction, strong currents causing flares to oppose them and weak current causing flares to face them. 4. A speculated use for the flare may be in water retention, allowing tentacles to be used.","312":"Distribution, feeding, and selected behavior of Arabella iricolor, A. semimaculata, Lumbrineris zonata, and L. erecta were studied in the interested of making comparisons in some aspects of their natural histories.","313":"The following conclusions can be made concerning the feeding habits of Dorvillea moniloceras: 1. A wide variety of food material is ingested including hydroids, Bowerbankia (a Bryozoan), sponge spicules, diatoms, and crustaceans. Detrital material is the most commonly found substance. 2. There is a tendency for larger worms to eat larger pieces of food and smaller worms to eat smaller pieces. 3. D. moniloceras was induced to eat some organisms under laboratory conditions that it apparently does not normally eat in nature, although available to them there.","314":"Salmacina tribranchiata (Moore, 1923) is abundant in the shallow waters of Monterey Bay. Studies of asexual reproduction in this species were conducted at Hopkins Marine Station of the Stanford University in April and May 1976, with the purpose of comparing events here with those in S. incrustans and of clarifying the process by which new thoraxes were formed in posterior reorganization. Subsidiary observations relating to systematics and rate of tube growth were also made.","315":"1. Lipid and glycogen content determinations were done on Myxicola infundibulum, Cirriformia luxuriosa, Halosydna brevisetosa, and Phragmatopoma californica collected form the Monterey Bay area of central California. 2. M. infundibulum and C. luxuriosa were starved for two weeks and their lipid and glycogen contents assayed. 3. M. infundibulum appears to rely on stored lipids at the onset of starvation. 4. C. luxuriosa appears to use some other reserve the onset of starvation.","316":"1. The host-directed behavior of Ophiodromus pugettensis, a commensal polychaete was investigated in the field and laboratory on Patiria miniata over a six week period during April and May 1976. 2. Field studies indicate: A. an increase in commensal populations with increasing host size; B. commensal populations of O. pugettensis fluctuate with time; C. clumped distribution of O. pugettensis on P. miniata; and, D. an increase in size and growth rate of O. pugettensis moving intertidally. 3. Laboratory results suggest: A. commensal distribution of P. miniata after small time periods is random; B. feeding as well as protection may be the nature of the commensal existence of O. pugettensis on P. miniata; C. large numbers of commensals on individual P. miniata are uncommon for long periods of time; D. O. pugettensis populations on P. gigantea and D. imbricata may be uncommon in the field due to host ingestion of the polychate; and, E. commensal O. pugettensis abandonment of P. miniata is uncommon unless conditions are extreme.","317":"1. Commensal Arctonoe vittata marked with a dark band were shown to bite Pisaster ochraceus significantly more than unmarked worms on host Diadora aspera. 2. Arctonoe were shown to search in response to the physical movement of the mantle response. 3. Arctonoe were found to bite, once aroused, if they were situated in a groove and contacted a tube foot. 4. Worms with palps removed were found to miss the tube foot when attempting to bite.","318":"The tubiculous polychaete, Myxicola infundibulum has been shown to utilize chemoreception in connection with its withdrawal response. The worms were found to be especially sensitive to divalent metal cations such as zinc and copper as they reacted to concentrations as low as 10 ^-7M of these metal ions.","319":"1. Adult Arctonoe vittata were tested in head-on aggressive encounters in the pallial groove of a Cryptochiton host. 2. Arctonoe was found to have intraspecific differences with respect to levels of aggression. 3. The most aggressive worm in a group successfully defends a host against others, evicting conspecifics. 4. Removal of the palps had no effect of the worms' aggression, but antennae removal significantly reduces aggressive behavior.","320":"1. In Dorvillea moniloceras and Halosydna brevisetosa ammonia comprises more than 80% of the nitrogenous excretion product. In Nerinides acuta, ammonia comprises only approximately 50% of the nitrogenous excretion product. 2. Excretion rates in these polychaetes are variable both within and among species, but generally tend to be between 3 and 8 ug\/ml worm\/hr. 3. In D. moniloceras ammonia excretion rate was found to decrease as ambient ammonia concentration increased, with some lessening of the effect with longer periods of exposure to high ambient ammonia concentration. 4. In D. moniloceras, worms exposed to high ambient ammonia concentrations and then placed in pure Instant Ocean excreted ammonia at much higher than normal rates. 5. In D. monilorceras, it was found that the worms' internal body ammonia concentrations increased in high ambient ammonia concentrations and with longer times of exposure to these concentrations.","321":"There appears to be both microhabitat and major habitat differences in the high-temperature torpor response of Tigriopus californicus corresponding to their geographic origins. 38 C is a critical temperature for all the populations. The determining factor in high-temperature related torpor is time, as the tolerance periods vary significantly between the populations. egg-carrying females can withstand high temperatures significantly better than the males. There is a large variation within an individual's torpor response to repeated high temperature stresses. However, the populations as a whole do maintain a consistent order of the least tolerant to the most resistant of temperature: North, Hopkins, South, L.A.1, L.A.2. These finding suggest a genetic basis for geographic differences in temperature tolerance as the 20-day minimum acclimation at 20 C would presumably eliminate any different short-term adaptations due to different environments.","322":"Work was done at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, on the migration of Tigriopus californicus and on the factors that influence it.","323":"The toxicity of several preparations obtained from Kuwait Crude oil to Tigriopus californicus was investigated. Whole oil, sea water extracted whole oil, the seawater extract, and similar material obtained from oil weathered for 40 days were compared. The LD-50's may be ranked as follows: The most toxic preparation was the seawater extract, followed by Whole Kuwait oil, washed Kuwait oil, weathered oil, and washed weathered oil, in order of decreasing toxicity. Males were found to be twice as susceptible as females to the whole oil preparation. Assays conducted in an attempted simulation of the tidepool environment revealed higher toxicities than were obtained under more tradition methods of assay.","324":"1. Tigriopus californicus activity varies from normal at 100% of oxygen saturation to that of a torpid condition at 0%. 2. Gross physiological torpor occurs around 4-9% of oxygen saturation. 3. Post-anoxic oxygen consumption rates show no repayment of an oxygen debt. 4. Increasing periods of anoxia show subsequently depressed rates of oxygen consumption. 5. Q10 values ranged from 1.4-1.9.","325":"Tigriopus do not have an endogenous rhythm synchronous with the tidal cycle which regulates the time when they leave the water column. Their survival behavior to wave action is keyed by the actual turbulence and involved a positive geotaxis.","326":"Tigriopus californicus, a high tide pool copepod, shows several separate responses to light. Dark-adapted T. californicus demonstrate a marked decrease in activity immediately following the onset of illumination, reaching a minimum after 1-2 minutes. Quantitative analysis of the light response indicates: (1) T. californicus exhibits a heightened sensitivity to light at an intensity of 0.35 watts\/m^2, (2) dark-adapted T. californicus more readily adapts to dim light than strong light, (3) the swimming velocity and activity of T. californicus increases with the intensity of light exposed to. T. californicus exhibits a specific \"dart-and-freeze\" response to shadow which may involve independent kinetic and tactic reactions, and which may be an escape mechanism.","327":"Tigriopus californicus is seen to form clumps in the field and in the lab under conditions of high salinity and desiccation. There is an indication that clumps may form in response to wave shock as well. Clump formation serves to increase the resistance of Tigriopus to high salinity and low temperature shock. A definite negative phototactic response is associated with clump formation and an increased thigmotaxis is suggested.","328":"Under laboratory conditions the major predators of Tigiopus californicus, in decreasing importance, are Clinocottus analis, Pachygrapsus crassipes, Anthopleura elegantissima, Pagurus samuelis, Heptacarpus paludicola, and Trichocorixia. However, in natural situations Pachygrapsus and Pagurus are probably the primary predators in the higher pools. Trichcorixia is not as common and if it is a predator, it is not as effective as the two crabs. Anthopleura is an effective predator in the lower high tide pools which receive some fresh sea water at high tides. Even lower in the intertidal are the cottid fish; these and wave action could efficiently keep the Tigriopus population to a minimum down here. Tigriopus were not normally found in the same tide pools as the shrimps. However, heavy wave action could wash Tigriopus down to the lower pools where the shrimp are found, allowing the shrimp to act as occasional predators.","329":"1. The loss of heat resistance in Tigriopus californicus occurs rapidly within the first 3 hours after removal from a high temperature condition. 2. In light of studies by Kontogiannis (1973) the acquisition and loss of heat resistance appears symmetrical in relation to time course. 3. The mechanisms involved in torpor and thermal death are different.","330":"The aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in high tide pools and the effects of these processes on Tigriopus californicus was investigated. Changes in dissolved oxygen and sulphide were measured in model preparations in the laboratory and compared to field measurements. Macrocystis pyrifera was the organic matter used in the study. Water column height and sediment depth were varied to obtain an estimate of the effect of these two variables on aerobic and anaerobic processes.","331":"1. Studies of diel cycles of migration and of responses to turbulence were made on the marine snail Littorina scutulata at Pacific Grove, California. 2. Snail populations in pools undergo an upward migration correlating well with approaching darkness and a reciprocal downward migration correlating with dawn. 3. Some other physical parameters fluctuate with the light cycle (e.g. oxygen concentration, temperature, etc.) and these might also influence the migration. 4. A migration of snails to the depths of a tide pool subjected experimentally to turbulence was noted. This response may be of adaptive advantage in avoiding displacement in unfavorable situations.","332":"Tigriopus californicus exhibit a unique osmoregulatory behavior which is highly adaptive in the high splash pool habitat. They conform osmotically in intermediate salinities and regulate hypo and hyper osmotically in high and low salinities respectively. Gut fluid appears to remain isosmotic with the environment. Evidence is presented to suggest the gut may be a regulatory surface in Tigriopus. The range of osmoconformance depends on the length of acclimation to a given salinity. O2 consumption in Tigriopus is high in low salinities decreasing as salinity rises. Metabolism appears not to change significantly over the conforming range 35 to 60 0\/00","333":"The short term responses to sudden changes in salinity, oxygen concentration, and pH, in terms of tendency to swim upward or downward were studied using a light coming either from above or below, to investigate the role of light as a directional cue to vertical movement.","334":"There is an extensive association between the epizooic diatom Cocconeis sp. and the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Incidence and frequency of Cocconeis in a tidepool may be a function of the amount of disturbance that pool experiences. From this study, it seems that more stable pools will have a higher incidence and broader frequency distribution of Cocconeis than will pools which are frequently disturbed. More stable pools may provide a better growth environment for the diatoms. Cocconeis are distributed evenly between male and female copepods and along the segments of the body. The diatoms are not selected as a food source but are digested when exoskeletons bearing them are consumed. Diatoms did not affect the brood size of the females they were living on. Further work on the copepods' response to stress with and without diatoms would be useful in elucidating the nature of the relationship between T. californicus and Cocconeis.","335":"Sex ratios of natural populations of Tigriopus californicus are correlated with the salinity of the pool that they were taken from. All pools samples above 70 ppt had a greater percentage of females than males. Salinity tolerance tests showed that females were more resistant to salinity stress. It is suggested that the observed trends of sex relations in the field may be due to differential mortality.","336":"Tigriopus californicus, a splash pool copepod of the intertidal zone, enters into a state of torpor in response to high salinities. Tolerance to, recovery from, and QO2 of the torpor state were studied. After 3 hours exposure to hypersaline conditions an ED-50 of 88.82 ppt was found. Acclimatization to salinity change occurred rapidly with a 64 percent decrease in torpor at 120 ppt in 20 hours. Recovery from 3, 6, 24, 34, and 48 hours exposure to 120 ppt showed greatest recovery occurring in a solution of 25 ppt. Recovery was rapid. All animals able to resume normal activity after torpor did so in 30 to 60 minutes. QO2 was determined over a range of salinities during 5 hours exposure. QO2 is inversely related to salinity in the range tested. QO2 ranged from a high of 7.78 uL\/mg-dry weight\/hr. at 16 ppt to a low of .78 uL\/mg-dry weight\/hr. at 145 ppt. animals aggregated at 34 ppt respired at a significantly lower rate when compared to free swimming animals at 34 ppt. The aggregated animals provided a Basal Metabolic Rate of 2.89 uL\/mg-dry weight\/hr. This allowed the calculation of the percent increase due to activity and the percent decrease by salinity. The values ranged from +169 percent at 16 ppt to -73 percent at 145ppt. The results indicate topor maybe the result of an inability to osmoregulate and the decrease in QO2 in torpor could be the combination of decreased activity and a decreased ability to metabolize oxygen by a direct effect of salinity.","337":"The susceptibility of Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912) from the coast of Central California to high salinities was studied using evaporation and hypersaline solutions. The ED-50 for coma occurring during 2 days of evaporation was 144 0\/00 with a 95% confidence interval of less than +\/- 0.003. The ED-50's for three different rates of salinity increase produced by the addition of hypersaline solutions were 132.2, 145.2, and 154.40\/00 with f-ED's of 1.02, 1.01, and 1.01 with 100% coma occurring at 10, 40, and 70 hours respectively. Fifty percent of the animals became inactive but not comatose at a salinity of 93.3 0\/00 with a 95 % confidence range of 97.97 to 88.86 0\/00 during a 2 day period of evaporation. Females with egg sacs appear to be more resistant than the general population.","338":"Simple behavior responses in the presence of the same or a different sex appear to take place in Tigriopus californicus Baker among males and appears to be inversely related to surface area and not volume. Among males, encounter including touching for longer than two seconds and copulating pairs with another animal whether male or female were common. Females alone showed no antagonistic behavior. In longevity studies, gravid females outlived non-gravid females and outlived males, the latter dying in half to greater than half the period shown by gravid females. Finally, an anatomy of mouth parts is shown in illustrations drawn to scale, and indicates distinct differences in a number of structures that may be of taxonomic significance.","339":"1. A population of Tigriopus californicus in constant darkness, 15 C, and 34 ppt salt water will distribute themselves such that the majority of the animals are at the top and the bottom. Those nearest the bottom, with the exception of those resting on the bottom, have a higher activity than those animals higher in the water column. 2. The bulk of the population is somewhat homogenous in behavior in that there appears to be few, if any, having distinct bottom-loving or top-loving tendencies. The majority seems to periodically move up and down. 3. There seems to be some intermediate light intensity, around 1600 LUX, causing density increase at the top of the water column. 4. The resting metabolism of a Tigriopus population over the temperatures of a naturally occurring tidepool seems to be temperature independent. 5. An actual preference to a salinity lower than sea water, about 18 ppt., seems to be apparent in an animal population.","340":"A population of Orchestoidea corniculata on a steep sandy beach at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California was studied to determine movement activity at the sand surface. Sampling was done with directional and nondirectional pitfall traps on a transect taken from the land vegetation to sea. The adult field population shows peaks of activity that exhibit both the circadian and circatidal rhythms reported by earlier investigators. The peaks of movement activity of adults and juveniles do not occur simultaneously but show a temporal separation.","341":"1. Moisture appears to be a stimulus for ammonia excretion; since this nitrogenous waste product is water-soluble, ambient moisture would facilitate diffusion. 2. L. planaxis displays peaks of excretory activity which coincide with times of greatest moisture, i.e., night and high tide, thus maximizing opportunities for excretion. 3. Light and dark seem to be the strongest factors influencing this change in excretory activity; the tidal correlations become more apparent when normal light and dark cues are removed. 4. If deprived of moisture, L. planaxis excretes smaller amounts of ammonia; since this compound is toxic, ammonic synthesis could be harmful if no means were available for excretion. 5. Rates of ammonia synthesis appear to be greater at night than during the day.","342":"When Littorina planaxis is suddenly immersed in sea water by wave action, it responds by opening its operculum, extending its foot and attaching to the substratum. Preliminary studies revealed variation in the time required for this response. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship of response time to phases of the tidal and diurnal cycles.","343":"1. Experiments conducted at Hopkins Marine Station, Mussel Point, Monterey Bay, California, have revealed that the intertidal barnacles Chthamalus dalli and C. fissus exhibit tidal feeding rhythms under conditions of constant temperature, constant light and constant submersion. 2. For both species of barnacle, the period of rhythm is between 11.5 and 12.5 hours. 3. It appears that C. dalli shows a clearer rhythm than C. fissus. However, this has yet to be ascertained unequivocally and could be a product of differences in collection sites. 4. Vibration, water currents, water volume and temperature are factors which can modify the character of the feeding rhythms. 5. The phase of the rhythm can be shifted by experimentally reversing the time course of the periods of exposure and submersion. 6. Clearest and most persistent rhythmicity was observed with maximum water volume and minimum vibration.","344":"Studies in the intertidal zone and in outdoor tanks were carried out at Pacific Grove, California, to determine the movements of Tegula funebralis and the environmental events correlated most closely with them. The snails cluster in sheltered areas at low tide especially during the day. Movement of T. funebralis into the open and upward on rocks is positively correlated with periods when the animals are washed and submerged. Tegula constantly submerged in outdoor aquaria showed no evidence of tidal rhythmicity, but followed a diel cycle of activity. During most of the day the snails stayed clustered under the rocks. In late afternoon and evening the snails moved out and climbed up the rocks and sides of the tanks.","345":"Marine collembolids, commonly called springtails, have a jumping organ, the furculata, which allows them to spring into the air. The adaptive significance of jumping behavior is unclear. This work was initiated to investigate the rhythmic nature of jumping behavior in a population and to consider the effect of temperature on this behavior. The work was divided into a preliminary field study followed by experimental work in the laboratory.","346":"In a meiofaunal population of the intertidal collembolid Archisotoma besselsi found on a pocket beach at Mussel Point, California: (a) An endogenous rhythm of vertical migration was demonstrated and a predictive model of location in the sand versus tidal condition was developed. (b) Tidal patterns with diel influences were implicated as major components of this endogenous rhythm. (c) Gross patchiness was exhibited by the population and was attributed in part to characteristics of the sand column. (d) The majority of the population was localized at approximately +4 feet above MLLW and was found to remain at varying depth within the sand even when completely inundated by the tides. (e) Exposure to approximately forty-nine hours of a 3-hours delayed tidal regime was insufficient to change expected trends in the migration pattern. (f) Suggestion was made that simultaneous occurrence of dawn and high tide temporarily destabilizes expected activity rhythms.","347":"Endogenous circadian rhythms in photosynthesis are described for the first time in the red alga Iridaea flaccida (S. & G.) Silva. These rhythms persist under constant conditions for three days showing a 36% difference between maximum photosynthetic rates at midday and minimum rates at night. Respiration is constant over the circadian cycle. Changes in the initial slopes of photosynthesis - irradiance curves at different circadian times suggest the involvement of the light reactions in this rhythmicity. Photosynthetic rates of I. flaccida are comparable in air and in water when the thallus is fully hydrated. A small amount of desiccation enhances the photosynthetic rates, while continued desiccation results in a marked decrease.","348":"1. Studies in the field and in the laboratory removed from tidal fluctuation indicate a tidal rhythm of activity in P. crassipes. The crabs are most active at lower low water. 2. The phase advance in LD 12:12 was found to be .9 min per lunar day. In DD the phase advance was found to be 5.5 minutes per lunar day. 3. When the times of lower low water shifted from day to night, crabs showed peaks of activity at both low tides. This suggests that the crabs' activity follows lower low water through the semi-lunar shifts of low tides. 4. A circadian rhythm was not found in this investigation. However, activity after sunset and the effect of light on the activity patterns of crabs in running wheels suggest that light plays an important role in modifying the crabs' behavior.","349":"Investigations of the rhythmic jumping activity of the intertidal collembolid Archisotoma besselsi has resulted in the following findings: (1) A circadian rhythmicity is present which indicates a sensitivity to the light-dark cycle of the solar day. (2) The free-running period for this rhythm is approximately 23.8 hours. (3) Different light regimes cause the rhythmic pattern to phase advance and delay in different ways, showing that the systems compensate independently according to the particular imposed light cycles. (4) The circadian clock is entrained to a light-dark cycle at a point in the cycle approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes before dawn. (5) Phase shifts in persistent rhythms seemed to vary as a function of temperature. (6) The circadian activity peaks and a set of smaller peaks maintain a constant difference between their two periods, indication that the two rhythms are caused by separate endogenous oscillators. (7) A tidal clock may be the driving oscillator for this smaller activity peak.","350":"Fluctuations in the vertical distribution of Littorina scutulata in tide pools were observed at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. L. scutulata appear to move into and out of tide pools as a function of the tidal cycle. This behavior is modified by the day - night cycle. The outward movement is positively correlated with dampness and negatively correlated with wave shock. The actual pattern of the in - out migration in each pool is complex and dependent on a large number of environmental variables which are not yet fully understood. The reasons for the in - out migration are still not known.","351":"The mysid shrimp Acanthomysis sculpta was observed to associate closely with the kelp canopy of Macrocystis beds during the day. At night but almost never during the day, it was found in plankton tows through open water adjacent to the kelp forest, suggesting nocturnal movement away from kelp. In constant light A. sculpta remained closely associated with kelp in aquaria and virtually never moved into adjacent open water. When subjected to a light - dark cycle 14:10 regime which coincided with day and night, more mysids moved away from kelp at night than during the day. In constant darkness A. sculpta showed an endogenous circadian behavioral pattern of close association with kelp during the subjective day and movement away from kelp during the subjective night. This behavior is discussed in terms of possible selective advantages, such as avoidance of predation and feeding on zooplankters which are present in the water column at night.","352":"A study of whole thallus absorbance was combined with direct measurements of photosynthesis in air to assess the photosynthetic capacity of desiccated Porphyra perforata. Fresh P. perforata was found to give a flat absorbance spectrum of high absorbance. Drying of the sample produces pigment peaks in the spectrum and a reduction in the photosynthetic rate. On rehydration, P. perforata resumes full photosynthetic capacity, and again exhibits a flat spectrum at high absorbance. The suggestion is made that these spectral results reflect an adaptation to P. perforata's intertidal habitat, for the subtidal Porphyra nereocystis gave peaks for both desiccated and fresh samples. In addition, photosynthetic rates measured during the day were higher than those measure at night, introducing the possibility that P. perforata possesses an endogenous photosynthetic rhythm. Cytological examination of P. perforata collected in situ over a 24 h period showed greatest mitotic activity when the plants were exposed during daylight hours.","353":"1. Tegula pulligo exhibits a diel vertical migration on the stipes of Macrocystis pyrifera. 2. The actual distribution and the extent of migration appear to be influenced by surge and light conditions in the kelp forest. 3. Aquarium studies indicate a negative response to light as well as showing increased activity of T. pulligo during periods just after dawn and dusk. These observations implicate changing light conditions as a cue for initiation of migration.","354":"Preliminary subtidal observations in the kelp forest adjacent to the Hopkins Marine Station at Mussel Point in mid-April yielded data suggesting that Tegula pulligo underwent a diel vertical migration on the kelp. Laboratory studies were undertaken in an attempt to demonstrate the observed field behavior, and to determine what effect light, or its intensities, may have on observed behavior. The conclusions were as follows: (1) T. pulligo undergoes a nocturnal migration in the laboratory similar to that seen in field studies. (2) T. pulligo requires at least three days to acclimatize to a laboratory environment in which light intensities are higher than those experienced in the field. (3) Animals knocked of plants undergo their greatest repopulation movement at night.","355":"Leptasterias hexactis (Stimpson 1862) shows a patchy distribution along the rocky intertidal of south Monterey Bay. It was found that the population density increased linearly with an increasing amount of available shelter. Starfish are found either under rocks or algal thalli, due mainly to a strong negative phototaxis. Possible major factors behind this phototaxis are visual predation and desiccation, and observations suggest that visual predation is primary. Leptasterias in shaded conditions tolerates exposure at low tide where there are no avian predators. The population at Pt. Pinos exhibits a high level of cryptic coloration which is proposed to result from visual predation. In the Hopkins Marine Station preserve, where populations of predators were highest, the stars occur in very low density. Food items of Leptasterias were examined at Pt. Pinos and under the Cannery and were found to be radically different both from each other and from previous work done in Puget Sound. In addition, escape responses were described for six local gastropods in the presence of Leptasterias. Tricolia pulloides showed the strongest response, with Mitrella tuberosa and Littorina scutulata exhibiting moderate responses. Barleeia haliotiphia and L. planaxis showed weak responses, and Bittium eschrichtii showed virtually no response to either chemoreception or contact with a starfish tube foot, even though Barleeia and Bittium are important food items.","356":"Seal impact on haul-out sites was evidenced by: 1) Greater G. canaliculata and R. affine cover. 2) Shorter and darker G. canaliculata plants. 3) Plant tearing shown by Phyllospadix root visibility. 4) Increased B. haliotiphila, L. cistula, and T. pulloides populations. 5) Decreased amphipod populations. 6) Fewer L. scutulata and T. funebralis. 7) Possible alteration of bacterial composition. Seal haul out behavior noted include: 1) Low tide population of 7 to 52 with a mean of 31. 2) Possible preference to haul out under conditions of sun and negative tides. 3) Preferred rocks low, sheltered, near deep water, inaccessible to land animals, and with as little nearby human activity as possible. 4) Particular rock preferences shown by individuals. 5) Rock conflicts characterized by snorting, snarling, head thrusts, flipper tapping, and pushing, with larger seals' success. 6) Sustained pair bonding outside of mating seasons.","357":"Gigartina papillata exhibits considerable morphological and physiological variation over its range of heights in its characteristic zone in the intertidal region. Female plants are the more abundant in the lower and medium regions of the zone, whereas male\/steriles predominate in the highest region. Individuals of higher regions of the zone are shorter and turflike, with relatively thicker thalli at the tips and middle protions; those of lower regions are longer and more isolated. The higher plants are better adapted to resist environmental stresses such as desiccation and salinity variation, as evidenced by slower drying rates and fewer signs of death relative to plants from medium and low regions. Male\/steriles from high and low regions are shown spectrophotometrically to differ in pigment composition, with the darker-appearing low plants containing more chlorophyll and biliproteins. Photosynthetic rates of lower male\/steriles surpass those of plants from other regions in parallel with differences in pigment content. Results on pigment content and photosynthetic rates of female plants, especially from lower regions, are difficult to interpret, possibly because of unknown physiological effects of the numerous cystocarps.","358":"Gigartina papillata (Rhodophyta) cultured in high concentrations of NO3, NH4 and guano for 10 days showed the same changes in R-phycoerythrin for all three conditions. G. papillata from an area with high guano exposure off China Point on the Monterey Peninsula showed significantly (p < .01) more phycoerythrin and significantly (p < .05) less carrageenan than control sites with little guano exposure. G. papillata was also shown to be significantly (p < .01) thicker in distal branches than in control sites. Endocladia muricata (Rhodophyta) and G. papillata from high guano density areas were shown significantly (p < .01) shorter and had significantly (p < .01) less branching than did the same species in control sites.","359":"Grazing pressure on the epiphytes on the fronds of the intertidal red alga, Rhodoglossum affine, was manipulated by adding and removing herbivorous gastropods. The green alga, Endophyton, and dense pennate diatom populations were found to be the most abundant epiphytes in percentage of frond area covered. The primary grazers were found to be the prosobranch gastropods, Tricolia pulloides, Barleeia haliotiphila, Tegula funebralis, and Tegula brunnea. Grazing by T. pulloides and B. haliotiphila was found to reduce the percentage of frond area covered by dense growths of pennate diatoms.","360":"Rhodoglossum affine (Rhodophyta) is a midintertidal alga of the Pacific Coast; its position is +0.5 to +4.5 ft. tidal level. The most abundant life phase is male plus sterile occuring higher than females in the same region. Tetrasporangial plants are sparse, possibly due to the season. Morphological measurements were taken which show plants higher in position have shorter fronds with larger holdfast area containing more fronds per holdfast than lower zoned plants. Stress tolerances of Rhodoglossum were examined noting the physiological changes of the plants in relation to vertical height and exposure. Higher level plants tolerated increased temperatures with greater survival than lower plants. Desiccation effects of Rhodoglossum were studied as a function of net photosynthetic rates. More exposed plants have higher rates after 1 and 5 hours of drying compared to calmer sites. Higher level plants exhibit a recovery of photosynthesis after 3 hours of desiccation.","361":"1. The mesofauna associated with the red algae R. affine and G. papillata, in the lower midtide zone, includes, in order of abundance: Nematoda, Copepoda, Barleeia haliotiphila, Tricolia pulloides, Lasaea cistula, mites, Polychaeta, Ostracoda, Nemertea, Isopoda, and Amphipoda. 2. Although the same taxonomic groups of small animals are present in R. affine and G. papillata, mesofaunal populations per unit area of R. affine are nearly twice those found in G. papillata for the more abundant taxa. 3. Populations of mesobiota in both plants appear to vary most directly with the amount of sediment present. 4. No size differences exist between mesobiota in R. affine and G. papillata.","362":"1. Tricolia pulloides and Barleeia haliotiphila are the two most common gastropods of the mesofaunal community associated with the mid-intertidal algal turf. Studies done on their distribution and abundance with respect to tidal height, algal species inhabited, and degree of wave exposure. 2. On a vertical face of algal turf Barleeia is significantly more abundant than Tricolia where their distribution overlaps by height and on algal species. For horizontal surfaces of algal turf they are not significantly different. 3. When compared on vertical algal turf Barleeia (+4.0 ft.) occurs 1.5 ft above Tricolia (+2.5 ft.). 4. Pt. Pinos, an exposed area, has significantly greater densities of both species than does Mussel Pt., a protected coast. Within sites the densities were not demonstrably different for horizontal surfaces. 5. Inhabitance of algal species varies with tidal height for Barleeia. At higher levels (4.0 ft. above 0.0 tide level) Rhodoglossum affine is preferred to Gigartina papillata while at lower levels (1.0 ft.) G. leptorhynchos is preferred to Rhodoglossum. 6. For Tricolia there is a change in plant occupancy with increasing size. Snails smaller than 1.5 mm occur predominantly in Gigartina leptorhynchos and G. canaliculata while the larger individuals have their greatest density on Rhodoglossum. 7. For Barleeia, there appears to be a downward movement when the snails reproductively mature as indicated by higher densities of both larger and smaller individuals at lower tidal levels.","363":"In all experiments, Tricolia pulloides populations shifted to outer regions of Gigartina papillata during optimum conditions of calm submersion in dim light. Desiccation is a considerable threat to Tricolia pulloides: an LD50 of 18 hours was reported for laboratory exposure (Firestone, 1979 unpublished Hopkins ms), and may be considerably less in bright sunlight. Thus, negative phototaxis seen in natural and artificial surroundings would seem an adaptive response. Inward movement of T. pulloides during strong surge minimizes the threat of being swept off the alga, since inner regions swing through a smaller arc and with less tangential velocity than frond ends. During trial surge experiments snails on outer areas of algae often were swept off if strong manual surge was begun suddenly. Thus, inward movement of T. pulloides populations during surge also appears to be an adaptive response.","364":"Eighteen samples of Gigartina papillata from relatively high, medium and low tidal heights in the upper midtidal zone on an exposed section of California coastline were analyzed for total carrageenan content. Results showed an increase in carrageenan content in relation to increasing tidal height. Desiccation and rehydration rates for high and low samples desiccated more slowly and rehydrated faster than low samples. The difference in carrageenan content is thought to account for this difference.","365":"Field studies of distribution of juveniles (4mm or less in greatest shell dimension) of Tegula funebralis and Littorina scutulata indicate they occupy largely separate subhabitats. T. funebralis juveniles occur predominantly in the sandy holdfasts of macroalgae and in rock crevices, less than 4.0 feet above mean lower low water. Littorina scutulata juveniles are found mainly on the fronds of macroalgae and in empty barnacle shells more than 3.0 feet above MLLW. The greatest overlap between the populations occurs between the 3.0 and 4.0 foot tidal levels. Laboratory experiments in aquaria with artificial tides demonstrate a similar partitioning. Juveniles of both species appear to be mainly relatively non-selective detritivores. Young Littorina scutulata consume more green algae and diatoms, but this may reflect incidental ingestion of epiphytes. While the two species consume roughly the same food, they obtain it in different places, so competition appears slight.","366":"1. The diet and reproductive biology of Tricolia pulloides was investigated during the period April-June, 1979 at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California. 2. T. pulloides feeds primarily on pennate diatoms grazed as epiphytes from the surfaces of algal fronds; small particles of detritus and pieces of other epiphytes are probably picked incidentally. 3. T. pulloides contains food in its gut at both high and low tide. 4. T. pulloides shows roughly a 1:1 ratio of males to females. Females, averaging 3.14 mm in length, are very significantly larger than the males, averaging 2.62 mm in length, though the smallest females are much smaller than the largest males. 5. Females carry up to 206 and average 56.5 yellow yolky oocytes. Up to 104 eggs, averaging 32.5 eggs per clutch, are laid in a sinuous ribbon, coated with clear jelly. Egg clutches are located on algal fronds. 6. Eggs cleave spirally and develop directly within 7 days into clear, miniature snails that feed on naviculoid diatoms and cling tenaciously to algal fronds with the aid of mucus threads.","367":"1. Studies were done on the exploitation of intertidal food resources by resident intertidal species and inshore movement of the nearshore fishes. Presence of intertidal food items in the gut contents of several nearshore fishes suggest extensive feeding occurs in the intertidal during high tides. 2. Gut content analyses of tidepool fishes implies that most if not all of their feeding occurs intertidally. Wooly sculpins were the most common tidepool species and consumed a wide variety of food items. The monkey face-eel appears to be herbivorous and consumes large quantities of intertidal algae. 3. Observations and gut content examinations of the black and striped surf perches show they obtain tiny invertebrate food items by picking off the algal turf. 4. The pile surfperch concentrates its diet on large visible food items, primarily hermit crabs and gastropods. 5. The feeding activities of the back and striped surf perches and the monkey face-eel result in tearing and trimming of the algal turf and thus have substantial impact on the intertidal community.","368":"1. The composition of algal species in areas adjacent to tidepools is significantly different from the algal composition of areas at least 50 centimeters away from a tidepool. 2. Rhodoglossum affine is particularly rare around tidepools, and this is consistent with the reports of the grazing preference in Tegula funebralis for this algae. 3. Mesofauna is generally more abundant around tidepools and decreases over a 10 cm distance above the water's edge. 4. It appears that the effects of tidepools do not generally exceed a range of 10 cm.","369":"The percentage of carpospores of Rhodoglossum affine (Harvey) Kylin adhered to glass plates was shown to attain a maximum level at 20 minutes following artificial release and drop to a significantly lower level at 4 hours. Early morphological development of tetrasporphyte embryos is described. One-week growth of embryos in response to gradients of temperature and salinity have been investigated. In all treatments embryos grew significantly faster if settled first at 14 degrees\/33o\/oo then moved to environmental growth baths than if settled directly in those baths. The results suggest that it may be useful to study environmental effects on early embryonic development and growth of R. affine carpospores when considering the geographical distribution of the adult tetrasporophyte.","370":"The existence of an anaerobic metabolic pathway which accumulates alanine and succinate was tested for in two snails which inhabit the intertidal region of the central Californian coast. Anaerobic conditions were induced by maintaining experimental animals in nitrogen flushed vials for 64 hours after which the whole soft tissue was assayed for alanine, succinate, and lactate. These assays were compared against the same for a set of controls. Results did not demonstrate an accumulation of more alanine, succinate, or lactate in the snails under anaerobic conditions than in the aerobic controls.","371":"A field survey and culture study of the microalgae living on the shells of the intertidal prosobranch mollusc, Tricolia pulloides (Carpenter, 1865), around the Monterey Peninsula, California have identified the microalgae commonly found growing on these shells and have shown that some of these microalgae are in greater abundance on shells from a wave exposed coast as compared to shells from a wave protected coast. Conchocelis rosea Batters, a shell-boring red alga not expected in high intertidal shells, was commonly found. An encrusting green alga identified as Pseudopringsheimia apiculata Setchell & Gardner showed free radiating irregularly branched marginal filaments in monostromatic regions and horizontally elongated cells in polystromatic regions, neither of which had been described for P. apiculata on macroalgal hosts.","372":"1) Vertical distribution of Acanthina punctulata near Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, ranges from 2 to 5 feet above MLLW, with the majority of snails in the Gigartina papillata - Endocladia muricata zone, 2.5 to 4 feet above 0 tide mark. 2) Near Hopkins Marine Station, Acanthina punctulata were distributed on 4 major substrates; rocks bearing barnacles, sandy bottomed tidepools, in and among A. elegantissima beds and among the red algae, Gigartina papillata and Endocladia muricata. 3) Activity and feeding of Acanthina punctulata at Mussel Point corresponds to a tidal cycle. At low tide, under conditions of exposure, Acanthina seeks the moisture of tidepools and A. elegantissima beds and remains relatively motionless. As the tide rises, activity increases and the snails crawl up onto the rocks and barnacles now washed or covered by the incoming tide. Feeding occurs according to the same pattern. The number of snails seen feeding increases as the tide rises and decreases and the tide falls. Of those snails feeding at low tide, a large proportion of them are feeding on prey caught during the previous high tide. 4) The field diet of Acanthina punctulata at Mussel Point includes the barnacles, Chthamalus spp. and Balanus glandula and the gastropods, Littorina planaxis and Littorina scutulata and Tegula funebralis. 5) Both field and laboratory observations on Acanthina punctulata indicate a hammering action of its tooth on the opercular opening of their barnacle prey. The obvious paralysis of the barnacle coupled with the absence of drill marks suggest the secretion of some sort of toxin through the barnacle's opercular opening. Hypobranchial gland extract has been found to have this same paralyzing effect when applied to the soft tissues or to the opercular openings of Chthamalus dalli. The spine may be used to pry open or to hold open the scutes (or the corresponding mantle flap lip) of the barnacle as poison is dripped in, or it may be used as an applicator, applying the toxin to the soft tissues or to the operculum opening of the barnacle.","373":"1) Salivary glands of the marine carnivorous snail Nucella emarginata contain a substance which causes positive chronotropic and ionotropic effects on the hearts of Mercenaria mercenaria and Mytilus californianus. 2) Comparison of the effects of salivary gland homogenate with the action of known doses of serotonin (5HT) on Mytilus hearts showed the glands contain the equivalent of 23-85 ug. 5HT\/g. fresh tissue. Thin layer chromatography demonstrated that the glands contain less than 150 ug. 5HT\/g. fresh tissue. 3) Mucous secreted from the hypobranchial gland of Nucella caused a marked increase in tonus and eventual cessation of beat of Mytilus hearts, effects similar to those produced by large concentrations of acetylcholine.","374":"1. The density of individual limpets living on rocks within four feet of Pollicipes clusters (R-limpets) per surface of rock is greater than that of the limpets living on Pollicipes (P-limpets) per surface area of Pollicipes plates. 2. The morphology of P-limpets differs from that of R-limpets. 3. Many standard taxonomical discretions of limpets do not apply to P-limpets. 4. P-limpets move from an individual Pollicipes to the next, but rarely leave the cluster. 5. P-limpets scrape food from the surface of Pollicipes. 6. P-limpets adjust better to new Pollicipes clusters and R-limpets adjust better to new rocks. 7. P-limpets are attracted to clusters at a greater rate than that of R-limpets. 8. P-limpets are better adopted to survive stresses on Pollicipes than R-limpets, and R-limpets survive stresses better on rocks and unnaturally arranged Pollicipes plates.","375":"While studying the mite Gammaridacarus brevisternalis Canaris, 1962, on Orchestoidea corniculata and O. californiana, a second, undocumented mite was also observed to infest the Orchestoidea. The mite was never found in the beach wrack where G. brevisternalis was also found.","376":"The life cycle of Gammaridacarus brevisternalis is documented for the first time. The life cycle appears to follow that of a typical Gamasida mite with two exceptions: it skips the prelarva stage and appears to undergo an adult molt. The life cycle is divided between beach wrack and beach amphipods of the genus Orchestoidea. Only the deutonymphs and adults are found on Orchestoidea. Gravid females are found almost exclusively on beach wrack. It appears that the wrack somehow induces fertility in the mites.","377":"Polycheria osborni is an amphipod found quite abundantly in a variety of compound ascidian colonies in the lower intertidal and subtidal areas from Puget Sound, Washington to Southern California. In the present study the distribution of Polycheria osborni in ascidians of the lower intertidal area of Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, California was observed, including the arrangement of the amphipods in the colony, the sizes of the amphipods in the various ascidians, and a sex ratio based on a subset of the population. Behavior of the Polycheria was also observed; their behavior in the burrow and the movement of them between burrows.","378":"Measurement of the physiological effects of the red algal epiphytes Smithora naiadum (Anders.) Hollenberg and Melobesia mediocris (Fosl.) Setch. and Mason on Phyllospadix torreyi Wats. were made near Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California. Field studies revealed a significant influence of these epiphytes on both the breakage incidence and length, with that of Melobesia being the most pronounced. Analysis of the photosynthetic rate of the seagrass shows a decrease in the photosynthetic maxima in both epiphytized samples at a light saturating intensity. Under light limiting conditions, an increase in photosynthetic efficiency and a change in chlorophyll a composition in both epiphytized sample types suggest an adaptive mechanism similar to those found in terrestrial and aquatic shade plants.","379":"1. Distribution studies indicate that differences in Notoacmaea paleacea population body sizes correspond to factors of wave intensity and desiccation from exposure to air. 2. The mean grazing rate on Phyllospadix torreyi is 38.63 mm of blade length per day or approximately 220mm over an average grazing residency of 5.67 days. N. paleacea consumes about 1.7 mg per day dry weight of P. torreyi. 3. Grazing results in over a 30% loss in photosynthetic capacity. 4. Gut analysis shows P. torreyi epidermal cells constitute about 85% of the diet of N. paleacea with small amounts of xylem cells and diatoms making up the remainder. 5. Periods of residency of individual limpets on blades of Phyllospadix torreyi may be grouped into two categories: full residency periods of 5.76 days and abbreviated residency periods of one observation. 6. Full residency periods indicate grazing behavior while abbreviated residency periods indicate rejection of the blade as a food source. This points to the existence of a mechanism that enables N. paleacea to detect previous residency. This mechanism controls overgrazing, a control that is critical to the success of P. torreyi and N. paleacea.","380":"Small green algae are commonly observed growing only on the backs of mid-intertidal limpets. A closer examination was made of this relationship. Several different green algae were found growing on limpet shells. Of these, Percursaria dawsonii (Hollenberg & Abbott 1968), and two species of Enteromorpha (Link , 1820) are morphologically very similar. The most heavily foliated limpets were found living on vertical landward faces of wave exposed rocks between +1 and +4 feet of Mean Lower Low Water. Fronds of one species of Enteromorpha, labeled E. sp.2 achieved greater length at sites which were more exposed to wave than where wave action was less severe. Enteromorpha sp.2 did not survive on limpet shells which were permanently affixed to mid-tidal rocks. In culture, E. sp.2 continued to grow on these empty shells. Additionally E. sp.2 grew in culture on granite, plastic, wood, Pollicipes plates, Mytilus shell, and free floating in the culture medium. A procedure for statistically measuring and comparing the cells of these algae is described and the relationship of one alga to its hosts is discussed.","381":"Caprella californica, C. brevirostris, and C. penantis may occur together on the hydroid Aglaophenia struthionides. Caprella incisa may occur on the bryozoan Tricellaria occidentalis growing in close proximity. Cleaning and feeding behavior of these caprellid species were compared under conditions of simulating natural water flow. All species were seen to engage in filter feeding and some in scraping and macrophagous feeding. Quantitative comparison of the main components of feeding behavior in the three species on Aglaophenia shows little obvious evidence of resource partitioning, and the role of motility and position are considered.","382":"Foettingeria, a ciliated protozoan, is an endosymbiote which occurs in the gastrovascular cavity of two species of Anthopleura. Its population size is limited by the size of its host. Foettingeria sp. has two locomotion modes, swimming and crawling. Crawling appears to be part of the foraging mode. Feeding is done using a cytostome. The ciliate appear to feed on tiny algal particles as well as zooxanthellae released from the host. While it may derive nourishment from mucous secretions as well as from gut fluids, there is no evidence that Foettingeria sp. harms its host even at high concentrations.","383":"Carpospores and tetraspores of Erythrocystis adhered preferentially to the trichoblasts of Laurencia. Infection of apical pits appeared to result from fortuitous attachment of spores to the proximal end of trichoblasts and extension of a unicellular rhizoid into the pit. No spore motility was observed. Infection rates in culture were approximately 30% for Laurencia collected at Stillwater Cove and Hopkins Marine Station, both areas in Monterey County, California. It is notable that the Laurencia at Hopkins is not infected by Erythrocystis in the field. In a survey of Laurencia pacifica from Stillwater Cove, it was found that up to 90% of the pits were infected by Erythrocystic germlings. Male, female and tetrasporophyte Erythrocystis occurred in the ratio of 1:1:3. Erythrocystis thalli (>1mm) predominated in the apical pits. The mean lengths of thalli from four locations on the Laurencia were significantly different (P < .05): 1*>2*>2*A>3*.","384":"1. The distribution of the size classes of Membranipora on Macrocystis reflects the possibility that two different stocks exist at the surface and bottom intervals in the study sites observed. Membranipora colonies found that the bottom intervals were larger in mean size and more abundant than at the surface, particularly at the HMS Point site. 2. Bottom zooids were found to be significantly larger than surface zooids. 3. Bottom zooids of Membranipora are better able to cope with desiccation stress. Surface zooids can withstand higher temperatures for longer periods of time. There is no significant difference in salinity tolerances between the two depth intervals. 4. Radioactive labeling experiment suggest that Membranipora receives some of its food supply from its host algae, Macrocystis.","385":"The giant chiton, Cryptochiton stelleri (Middendorff, 1846) is known from northern Japan to southern California for its thick brick-red girdle covered by tufts of crimson calcareous bristles (Smith, 1975). close examination of this mollusk often reveals that Cryptochiton's dorsal surface also maintains a miniature forest of red algae. Pleonosporium squarrosum Kylin (Ceramiceae), the 2-3 cm tall red alga is a leading member of the chiton's epizoic community. The distribution of P. squarrosum is limited to pilings of docks at Friday Harbor, Washington (Kylin, 1925) and the backs of a few subtidal invertebrates in Monterey, California (Abbott and Hollenberg, 1976). P. squarrosum appears very selective in its habitat, yet common on the Cryptochiton despite an earlier report by MacGinitie and MacGinitie (1968) which indicated the Cryptochiton backs did not carry a distinctive flora or fauna. The purpose of this study was to investigate the obvious chiton-alga association -- its incidence, distribution, causality and natural history.","386":"The infection by Arthopyrenia sublitoralis in the shells of Collisella digitalis superficially appears to affect the strength of the shell material. A series of three tests designed to measure the effects the lichen may have on the erodibility and, indirectly, the strength of the shell, indicate that the infection is having no effect.","387":"The effects of larval trematode infection on the thermal resistance, respiration rate, rate of Ulva sp. consumption and gamete production of Batallaria attramentaria were determined. Nonparasitized snails showed a greater survival rate at 46 degrees C for 1 hour ( 0.1>p>0.05) and at 46 C for 1.5 hours (p<0.05). The average respiration rates of infected and noninfected snails did not differ significantly. Individual respiration rates varied widely in both parasitized and nonparasitized snails. Infected snails consumed more Ulva sp. than uninfected snails. (p<0.06). No eggs or sperm were observed in heavily infected snails.","388":"Spore packets from Smithora naiadum (Anderson) Hollenberg were shown to settle preferentially on its natural host Phyllospadix torreyi (S. Wats.) over several other natural and artificial substrates. Fluorescein dye was introduced to both intact and rhizome-severed basal portions of Phyllospadix blades but showed little translocation beyond point of entry. This dispelled the possibility of distant translocation of nutrients through Phyllospadix and into its epiphytes. An attempt to qualitatively determine if Smithora receives biochemical communicants from its seagrass host yielded no such products. A possible procedure for approaching the question was developed though. A possible circadian variation in photosynthetic rate in the red alga Smithora was demonstrated.","389":"The commensal pea crab Pinnotheres pugettensis inhabits about 33% of the subtidal population of its ascidian host, Stylea montereyensis, in southern Monterey Bay, California. No pea crabs were found in intertidal S. montereyensis. Of 247 tunicates dissected 62 contained one crab, four held two crabs and one tunicate contained three crabs. There was never more than one adult female P. pugettensis per tunicate. The crabs live in the anterior third of the atrial cavity of the tunicate, and feed by reaching into the pharyngeal cavity, through a small well-healed hole situated dorsally in the pharyngeal wall, and taking pieces of the rope of mucus and trapped food particles rolled up by the ascidian dorsal lamina. We saw no evidence of filter feeding by adult P. pugettensis. Eggs hatch as advanced zoeae, which molt to a second zoeal stage in 10-12 days, to a megalops at 20-24 days, and to the first juvenile instar at 28-30 days. Adult males are dark brown and hard shelled, and generally smaller than the translucent and soft shelled adult females.","390":"Parasitologists have been aware for many decades that fishes serve as hosts for a variety of helminth and protozoan parasites. In 1965, Mackenzie and Gibson reported a diverse parasite community existing in the flat fishes flounder and plaice from the coast of England. Their study is probably the only detailed study ever published on parasite distribution and incidence in flat fish, and it is safe to say that there have been no published studies on parasites of the flat fish Citharichthys sordidus, the Pacific Sanddab. This paper describes five prevalent internal parasites of Citharichthys sordidus, and reports on the incidences of infection, average parasite loads per sanddab, and distributions of parasites within the host and host population.","391":"1. There are direct positive correlations between infection by shell borers, shell density and the breaking point of abalone shells. 2. Cliona celata bores into all species studied with the greatest infection in H. rufesens and the least in H. cracherodii. 3. Penitella conradi has lowest infection rates in H. cracherodii and highest rates in H. rufesens, H. fulgens and H. corrugata. 4. Penitella and Cliona have distinct boring patterns and damage the shell in different ways.","392":"An undescribed species of heterophyidae cercariae (not in Yamaguti, 1975) emergences rhythmically from Battilaria attramentaria. Emergence occurs early in the morning. Constant light and constant dark do not immediately alter the emergence pattern. Phase shift experiments indicate that emergence is controlled by an endogenous clock and a sensitivity to light.","393":"1. A. borealis in the free swimming condition does not swim in a random fashion. 2. A. borealis exhibits a positive heliotropism in the free swimming condition. This tropism is dependent on intact eyes. 3. A. borealis actively swims counter to currents. This behavior occurs without intact eyes. 4. A. borealis exhibits a possible negative geotropism. This behavior seems to rely on intact eyes. 5. A. borealis can survive for up to 10 days in a free swimming condition. 5. A. borealis cannot survive rapid, prolonged exposure to freshwater. 7. A. borealis rapidly dies when exposed to air.","394":"The hydroids Aglaophenia struthionides (Murray, 1860), Eucopella everta (Clark, 1896), and Abietinaria spp. in the low intertidal zone at Mussel Point, Pacific Grove, Monterey Bay, California, often bear the adult pycnogonids Tanystylum duospinum (Hilton, 1939) and Lecythorhyncus hilgendorfi (Bohm, 1879). Larval stages of these pycnogonids were found living and feeding on Eucopella everta. The larvae of Tanystylum duospinum are ectoparasitic. Those of Lecythorhyncus hildendorfi are endoparasitic in the gastrovasuclar cavities of hydranths. Larvae of both species feed on the gut contents of Eucopella everta, often on the same hydroid colony.","395":"A possible new marine cercaria found in the snail Batallaria attramentaria at Elkhorn Slough, California was described. A survey was performed on possible intermediate hosts and the cercaria's penetration behavior in one of them, Gillichthys mirabilis. As the cercaria aged, its activity and penetration ability decreased. The duration of successful cercarial penetration was dependent upon the levels of cercarial activity prior to attempted penetration.","396":"The distribution of the epiphytes Melobesia mediocris (Fosl) Setch & Mason and Smithora naiadum (Anders.) Hollenb. on the seagrass Phyllospadix torreyi Watson was surveyed around Mussel Point at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, in the spring of 1980. Melobesia was found to be the dominant epiphyte on Phyllospadix along the wave exposed western side of the point, while Smithora was found in abundance on the more protected eastern side. Colonization in the field of the new growth of Phyllospadix by the epiphytes occurred within 25 hours. It appears that Melobesia will colonize young blades more rapidly and in greater numbers that Smithora. Percent cover of Melobesia on Phyllospadix was lowest on the new growth, increased in the older portions of the blade, and low at the senescent ends of the lamina. Population structure showed male gametophytes to be rare and tetrasporophytes and female gametophytes in almost equal abundance. Mean diameters of tetrasporophytes were larger than those of the female gametophytes. These mature plants however showed no increase in size with age.","397":"The hermit crabs Pagurus samuelis and Pagurus granosimanis live in close association with the sea anemones Anthopleura xanthogrammica and A. elegantissima in the intertidal region at Hopkins Marine Station. The crabs are often observed walking on the columns and tentacles of the anemone without any response from the nematocysts. This appears similar in many ways to the relationship established between the tropical anemone fish and their hosts. The hermit crabs go through a sequence of behavior in which they acquire a coating of mucus from contact with the anemone. The mucus is acquired through a series of behavioral steps exhibited by the crabs: poking, brushing, and stroking the anemone. Once acclimated, the crab freewalks among the tentacles feeding off of small food particles stuck to the Anthopleura and even removing food from the gut of its host. The protective mucus coat gradually loses its effectiveness if the hermit crab is isolated from anemones. This is a symbiotic relationship benefiting the crabs by providing a source of food and protection from a potential predator.","398":"The young of intertidal Crepidula adunca are dispersed from the female and sink down into sandy, shell-fragmented, lower habitats where they attach onto small gastropod shells. As they outgrow the host shell, they move onto larger gastropod shells, producing a strong correlation between size of Crepidula and size of host shell. At some point in their life cycle, the Crepidula experience a strong attraction towards Tegula funebralis shells which does not involved the actual animal or the shell surface material or texture but rather possibly an increased sensitivity and\/or attraction towards Tegula shell shape. At this point the Crepidula attach to adult T. funebralis which prefer rock faces and crevices. It is in these rocky habitats that the adult Crepidula are found most abundantly in the intertidal region.","399":"Fertilized eggs of Ascidia ceratodes hatch in about 24 hours. Resulting free swimming larvae settle and begin metamorphosis 1-2 days later. Development of the major organs involved in filter feeding occurs 36-48 hours after settlement. Feeding begins at 60-72 hours. Spontaneous contraction begin at about 48 hours and contractions in response to physical disturbance at 72 hours.","400":"A study of predators of ascidians in Pacific Grove, California.","401":"Direct observations of ascidian neural gland complex in live dissections and histological preparations. Some preliminary histochemical and physiological tests provide suggestive leads for further investigation of the nature of this gland.","402":"Specimens of Ciona intestinalis were observed in the lab and in their natural habitat for evidence of spontaneous contractions. In the laboratory oxygen tension and temperature were varied to induce spontaneous contraction modulation. It was found that Ciona intestinalis contracts at an average rate of 6.3 times\/h at 15-15.5 degrees C in nature. Intermediate levels of oxygen tension have no effect on contraction rate but increasing temperature increases contraction rate. 3 contraction types can be isolated in Ciona intestinalis (cross-oral, cross-atrial, and both siphons). At higher contraction rates more cross-oral and fewer \"both\" contractions occur. Observations at high contraction rates indicate that contraction durations occur between 10-15 sec with little variation.","403":"The present work presents a successful new technique allowing selective dechorionation and removal of follicle cells of the Botryllus egg. With the aid of this technique the phenomenon of colonial self-sterility was examined. The localization of the barrier to self fertilization in the chorion or follicle cells is documented with an increased degree of certainty and detail.","404":"Eggs from solitary and colonial tunicates were fed to adult Ascidia ceratodes and Ciona instestinalis. Those eggs which are normally spawned, A. ceratodes and C. intestinalis, were recovered unharmed from fecal pellets and embryonic development observed to continue. Dechorionated eggs and viable tadpoles, however, were digested. Furthermore, eggs which are invariable brooded, those of Clavelina huntsmani and Botryllus sp., were not recovered intact. Fertilized Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus eggs were also able to survive ingestion by the adult A. ceratodes. A correlation was noted between protease-insensitivity of the chorion and fertilization membrane and the resistance to digestion. It is suggested that the proteolytic insensitivity of the extra-embryonic investments serves to protect eggs normally spawned from digestion by filter-feeding adult tunicates.","405":"Hatching in Ascidia ceratodes seemingly involves two inter-related functions - that of movement to cause rupture, and enzymatic removal of the follicle cells and possibly, enzymatic digestion of the chorion to facilitate escape. Direct evidence of the importance of movement was not obtained, however indirect evidence as seen in increased movement prior to hatching; decreased hatching time in defolliculated eggs, and non-specific sites of rupture, all tend to suggest its importance. Direct evidence of a hatching enzyme was obtained using an unconventional and novel assaying agent - Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus eggs. Trypsin-like enzymes cause defolliculation and are essential in the overall hatching process. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity prevents hatching.","406":"The similarities in external morphology and distribution have made distinction between Aplidium arenatum, Aplidium propinqum and Synoicum parfustis difficult in the field and laboratory. Quantitative differences have been found between the species in: height and area of the lobe top; the shape, color, and clustering of lobes; the number of systems per lobe; the number of zooids per lobe; the number of zooids per system; zooid size; the number of rows of stigmata; the number of developing embryos in the atrium; and habitat.","407":"The rejection reaction following tip - to - side contact between two vascular ampullae of two incompatable Botryllus oozooids differs in the two ampullae. The ampulla that initiated contact (aggressor) forms a distal blood clot and responds in one of three ways that differ in their degree of injury to the aggressing ampulla: (1) loss or injury to the ampullar pad cells (2) loss of distal end of ampulla by constriction (3) rapid ampullar disintegration. The receiving ampulla showed a more subtle rejection response, as did some other apmullae of the oozooid pair not involved in an ampullar contact.","408":"We report here on the longitudinal body wall muscles of Ciona intestinalis using standard morphological and physiological methods. The muscle cells are arranged in long parallel bundles which are easily dissected and rapidly contract in response to electrical stimulation. Relaxation is slow. Activation of action potentials and twitches are critically dependent on external Ca, whereas extracellular Na shows no effect on excitability. Contractile response to depolarization via action potentials or KCL application disappears at similar rates upon application of Ca free solutions. Our results do not support the existence of intracellular stores of releasable Ca and suggest that Ca influx is the sole source of activator Ca.","409":"The compound ascidian Botrylloides sp. was anaesthetized through the application of two types of substances. An isotonic solution of Tris chloride was found to be an effective anesthetic. The addition of various concentrations of the divalent cations magnesium and calcium altered its action. Addition of calcium caused a slowing of this action, while addition of magnesium accelerated the process. Three local anesthetics, procaine, dibucaine, and tretracaine were tested for anesthetic effectiveness on Botrylloides. All three paralyzed the animals, but only procaine was found to be useful as a reversible anesthetic. Full recovery times were obtained for various exposure periods to procaine and a dosage-response curve for both anesthesia and reversal were constructed.","410":"1. The bidirectional hearts of the tunicates Ascidia ceratodes, Ciona intestinalis, and Clavelina huntsmani showed preferred directionality in number, rate, and period of beating. 2. Each species tested demonstrated a characteristic reversal pattern, but there were large individual variations from the species averages. 3. Temperature affected both rate and period of beating, but it did not affect number beats per period. 4. Salinity changes and injury had significant effects on the cardiac function of Clavelina huntsmani. Changes in the pH had no effect. 5. Heart rate slowed just before reversal in all six species tested. 6. There are at least five different types of heartbeat reversal. 7. An endogenous counting mechanism seems to be a major means of regulating reversal.","411":"The habitat niches of the different species of ascidians which occur in a rocky intertidal region of Cabrillo Point, Pacific Grove, Monterey County, California appear to be largely delimited by the physical factors of intertidal height, degree of exposure to wave action, and slope of substrate. Strength of current flow was also investigated and was found to be closely correlated with wave action. Species which overlap broadly along gradients of one of these parameters are usually fairly well separated along gradients of the other two factors. Interactions between parameters are frequent, as in cases of species which occur higher, lower or on different slopes in areas with differing wave actions. Several pairs of species show distinct boundaries between their ranges, which is probably a result of interspecific competition. The growth forms of the species occuring in different sites is strongly correlated with the degree of wave action at these sites. Species with sheet-like growth forms dominate heavily exposed areas, and species with erect growth forms more protected areas. The relative resistances of the different growth forms to pounding and shearing forces form waves could be responsible for this trend.","412":"Polycheria osborni is an amphipod of the suborder Gammaridea that is known to live in the tunic of several different species of colonial ascidians. The present study was undertaken to provide additional data on the distribution and abundance of the amphipod, a quantitative look at the ability of ascidians to heal a vacated Polycheria osborni burrow, and observations on the feeding habits of Polycheria osborni. It also reports the finding of a second species of commensal gammarid amphipod, this one living in the common cloacal cavity of the ascidian Aplidium solidum.","413":"Fecal pellets of seven species of tunicates (Ascidacea) were collected from animals inhabiting the same intertidal habitat near Pacific Grove, California in order to asses the kinds of material ingested. Diatoms and dinoflagellates were the most abundant. Tunicates producing pellets with large numbers of dinoflagellates were of a different species and morphology than those showing diatoms to dominate. Five species were selected for laboratory feeding studies and involved solitary, social, and colonial animals. Our observations indicate that the tentacles show important activity when encountered with potential food particles.","414":"In the rocky intertidal regions of the mid-California coast, full utilization of all available space by competing algae and invertebrates, both solitary and colonial, shows the importance of space in the community. That so many competitors here are colonial gives reason to believe they are successful. The purpose of this study was to examine the competitive associations between colonial ascidians at Cabrillo Point and evaluate competitive growth forms in order to determine a relationship between structure and competitive strategy. Finally, growth forms were evaluated according to their competitive abilities.","415":"B-D-glucosidase activity increased during development of the barnacle, Pollicipes polymerus. The activity increased 18.7-fold from early blastula through the nauplius stage and at all stages exhibited a 3:1 ratio of soluble to particulate form and was activated by the detergent Triton X-100. A similar activity was also found in the adult digestive tract. The possible roles of the exhibited activity are discussed.","416":"Analyses of fecal pellet contents of freshly collected Ligia occidentalis showed the principle foods were a variety of brown, red and green algae wrack. Ligia occidentalis prefers to eat the brown algae Macrocystis pyrifora and Cystoseira, when given a choice of several seaweeds. A correlation was established between the fecal pellet contents and algae available in the study sites.","417":"An endogenous circatidal rhythm was described in both individuals and populations of the upper intertidal barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus fissus. These rhythms persisted for at least 8 days under constant conditions with peaks of activity initially corresponding to times of high tide. A circatidal period of 27 hours was observed in activity of Balanus glandula, while the period of activity of Chthamalus fissus, 25 hours, was much closer to that of the tidal cycle. No circadian rhythms were observed in any individuals or populations studied under constant conditions in the field. The hypothesis was made that the adaptive advantage of such an endogenous rhythm would be in the ability to anticipate periods of activity and inactivity and physiologically prepare for them.","418":"Centipede populations in the splash zone of Monterey Bay were surveyed, and a high density of the Geophilomorph Geophilus becki was found beneath the rocks in a zone just above the attached alga Endocladia muricata and below a tidal level of +5.6 feet. A high percentage of these were found in groups. Few Lithobiomorpha were found in the splash zone.","419":"The diet of Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani Audubon) studied at Pacific Grove, California, included many limpets. In this study, the birds usually took limpets clearly exposed to view, not those hidden beneath larger leafy algae. Limpets on very steep slopes were only attacked if the bird could do so while standing an adjacent gentle slope. Most of the limpets eaten were Collisella pelta and C. digitalis; virtually none were C. scabra living on foraging sites. Evidence is presented indicating that selective predation by oystercatchers is important in the localization of C. pelta under large leafy algae (animals in plain view are selectively preyed upon), and in the separation of the habitat niches of C. scabra and C. digitalis. C. digitalis survives best on steep surfaces inaccessible to foraging oystercatchers; C. scabra, largely not subject to oystercatcher predation, is more abundant on horizontal surfaces where competition from other grazing limpets may be less.","420":"The distribution of twelve supralittoral lichen species was investigated on the southern shores of Monterey Bay, California and related to their exposure to sea-water spray, aspect to the sun, and tidal height. Percentage cover was determined using a pin-hit technique. Tidal height and exposure to sea-water influence the distribution of several species, while aspect only affects one species. Aspect limits the distribution of Acarospora schleicheri (Ach.) Moss. to south-facing slopes, and influences the total percentage cover of other lichens. Some species investigated reflect different degrees of tolerance to salt water. Caloplaca bolanderi (Tuck.) Magn., Lecanora pinquis Tuck., Lecanora phragmites Tuck., and a pyrenocarpus lichen appear most tolerant to salt water exposure. The physical effects of waves may prohibit lichens from settling below 1.5 meters above the red alga Endocladia muricata (Post. and Rupr.) J. Ag., mean height approximately 1.2 meters above zero tide level. No upper limit was observed.","421":"The marine snail, Littorina planaxis, has the ability to distinguish between solutions of high and low salinity. Research indicates that salinity is determined primarily through the detection of chloride. The region of detection seems to be localized in the area, between the operculum and the foot, known as the operculigerous disc.","422":"The mechanisms by which the acrosome reaction occurs was studied in the marine snail Tegula funebralis and an attempt to define the conditions surrounding the acrosome reaction was made using various inhibitors and inducers of the acrosome reaction. The results presented here and data from previous work done on the mechanism governing acrosome reaction indicate that Ca2+, Zn2+, and cAMP may be involved in the mechanism which triggers and\/or mediates the acrosome reaction in T. funebralis.","423":"The general behavior of the supralittoral pseudoscorpion Garypus californicus was studied along the shoreline of Pacific Grove, California, where it is commonly found. Behavior, observed in the field and the lab, was analyzed and broken into components which were described and figured. The components were divided into solitary and social behaviors, which were further divided into more specific categories containing specific actions and postures. 116 encounters between adult organisms were analyzed and treated as sequences of behaviors. An \"intruder\" either randomly entered or was placed in the area of an initially stationary \"host\". Threatening gestures made by the two participants usually resulted in one organism leaving or a fight. In 101 cases the end result was the intruder leaving. Significant amounts of clustering behavior were found and correlate well with the initial posture of the host.","424":"This study was undertaken to characterize the spatial and temporal distributions of Acanthina; specifically, to determine in what habitats, engaged in which activities, in what numbers, and when these snails occur.","425":"1) Preferential trail following is observed for all combinations of sex of snail and trail, and no apparent sex differences in percentage following are observed. 2) Preferential trail-following is observed for L. planaxis on both misted and dry trails. Trail polarity information decreases as the trail-age increases. The detectable level of polarity information decays along a time course similar to that found for submerged L. littorea trails (Gilly and Swensen, 1978). 3) Trail polarity information can be detected thru 100 micron pore size nytex screen, but cannot be detected thru 0.22 micron pore size milipore filters. 4) The cephalic tentacles of L. planaxis distal to the eye spot play no significant role in placing polarity information onto the trail.","426":"The distribution and activity patterns of the limpet Collisella paradigitalis was studied. The vertical distribution was found to be .7 - 3.2 meters above MLLW with average density .27 meters below Endocladia zone. The limpets were found primarily in protected areas with 91% of the population found on vertical or slightly overhanging surfaces. On average, the limpets moved 13.4 cm during high tide, with larger limpets moving a greater distance. Very infrequent homing was found in 67% of the population.","427":"1. C. scabra less than 4mm long home. The rate at which they change home sites may be greater than that of adults. 2. Homing in adults persists after burning the home site and surrounds. 3. Chemical trail following may play a role in homing of juveniles, limpets which have voluntarily changed sites, and limpets removed from the field and placed on new substrates.","428":"Salt tolerance and acclimation ability of two seashore lichens, Lecanora pinguis and Niebla homalea, were examined to determine to what extent they are actually marine adapted. Photosynthetic rate was used as an indicator of the lichens' response to different conditions. Tolerance was tested by soaking samples in distilled and various salt water concentrations for various lengths of time, and acclimation ability was determined by giving preliminary treatments of distilled or salt water and then observing their effects on responses to later treatments. L pinguis was found to be more tolerant of salt water than N. homalea, but N. homalea showed ability to acclimate to either marine or terrestrial conditions, while L. pinguis could not adapt to terrestrial conditions. Thus, L. pinguis is a true marine lichen, while N. homalea is more accurately described as a salt-tolerant terrestrial lichen. Typical photosynthetic rates for this study were 150 ul\/g-hr for L. pinguis and 75 ul\/g-hr for N. homalea as measured on a Gilson model IGRP 14 differential respirometer.","429":"Within each species, Niebla combeoides (Nyl.) Rund. and Bowl. and Niebla homalea (Ach.) Rund. and Bowl., thalli growing on different slopes will contain the same amount of water. Regardless of slope, in two out of three experiments, N. homalea shows that it contains more water than does N. combeoides. The water content of these lichens depends largely on atmospheric moisture.","430":"The high intertidal acorn barnacles Chthamalus dalli and C. fissus both occur at Cabrillo Point. C. fissus occurs in two morphs: one has a narrow, slit-like aperture and the other has an oval orifice and is externally indistinguishable from C. dalli. Analysis of population samples found distinct patterns in the distribution of the species and morphs. These patterns applied to both micro- and macro-habitats. C. dalli was more abundant in the sites exposed to wave action while C. fissus dominated populations in protected habitats. The oval morph of C. fissus preferred sunny areas, whereas the slit form preferred moist, shaded environments. The slit and oval morphs of C. fissus develop their morphological traits at an early stage of development, and an argument is made for the genetic determination of the morphs of C. fissus.","431":"Surveys were made of the vertical distribution of Pisaster ochraceus and its possible prey items on a seawall in Monterey harbor. Both predator and prey were found to fall into the same zone, dominating the region from .25 to .6 m above mean low low water. The diet of this particular population of P. ochraceus was found to consist almost entirely of barnacles, primarily Tetraclita, Megabalanus californicus, and Balanus nubilus, for the simple reason that those are the prey items available on the wall. Although the behavior of individuals may appear to be erratic and random, when the movements of the total population are looked at, they fall into certain patterns. When divided into \"upper\" and \"lower\" zones, it was observed that individuals in the upper zone predominantly move down, and those in the lower zone predominantly move up. As evidenced by results from concentrated 15 and 30 minutes watches, and 12 and 24 hour measurements, the majority of movement of P. ochraceus takes place during the high high tide and\/or at night.","432":"Three sites in Monterey County California were chosen to study microhabitatual differences in two closely related holothuroids, Cucumaria curata, and Cucumaria pseudocurata. Collections were taken along a gradient of exposure, from protected pools receiving occasional, moderated splash at low tides to the lowest levels of the intertidal receiving heavy, constant splash, to determine distribution of both species. C. curata dominated in the exposed situations, whereas C. pseudocurata dominated in the protected areas. Two interrelated factors in the niche differences are wave action and desiccation, which were moderated by the cucumbers' association with encrusting corallines, Corallina, Claiarthron, and Mytilus, the behavior of clinging into depressions, and the habit of aggregation.","433":"Spines of sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus were deflected through varying angles and the resistive forces offered by their ligaments were recorded. Data obtained for spines out of catch and spines in catch show basic differences in shape as well as amplitude. This difference in shape was also observed in the data obtained for different spines in catch. The contractile force of the muscle layer at the base of the sea urchin spines was determined and found to significant in comparison to the resistive upon 10 degrees deflection offered by the spine ligaments when in a state of catch. A survey of a population of spines, both agitated and non-agitated, was conducted to obtain an objective definition of the state of catch vs. non-catch. An angular limit to deflection was found to exist for spines in catch, beyond which their ligaments would become irreversibly damaged. Experimental and mathematical calculation of Young's Modulus was done for a spine ligament in catch, and this was found to be similar to that given for vertebrate tendon at the same strain. The relationship between resistive force offered and angular deflection was examined, and it was found to be non-linear. The possibility of nervous control of catch was considered, although results obtained make this seem unlikely. That the setting of catch is Ca+2 dependent was here confirmed. Furthermore, the reversibility of the effects of Ca2+ depletion were confirmed, although the process of reversal remains unclear, for recovery time was found to be very long. The effects of protein inhibitors on catch were also studied, and the preliminary results provide strong evidence for an enzymatic mechanism in the control of catch.","434":"Clay plates with different prey items to select from and different distributions of prey were suspended in a 80 1 tank. The plates were large enough, it was hoped, to represent an area of rock that would normally be occupied by the Leptasterias. The starfish were never handled but could be observed while foraging and selecting prey. A flat sea table was also used and again the animals were observed but not disturbed. It is strongly suspected that prey selection has a component of learning involved in the behavior. The leptasterias also seem to optimize food choices.","435":"The connective tissue sheaths in the tube feet of Pisaster ochraceous were studied. The role played by the spiral fibers in the inner layer of this sheath during extension of the tube foot was also examined. This was done by fixing the tube feet at various states of extension, and by measuring the external dimensions and the fiber angle of the fibers. These spiral fibers were found to be extensible when the tube foot was extended or contracted, and the value of strain for the extended tube foot was very large (1.84). The fibers were also found to provide adequate hoop stiffness during the contracted state to prevent circumferential deformation of the tube foot.","436":"The skeletal system in starfish greatly influences behavior and ecology. Locomotory behavior, especially aspects of flexibility, is dependent on the properties of the skeletal system. Anatomical and mechanical properties are here examined to determine the relationship of ossicle mass, material stiffness, and flexibility. Flexibility behavior is also observed to examine the range of degree and rate of bending among the 3 subject species. It is concluded that a) the greater the volume fraction of ossicles, the stiffer the tissue and b) The greater the volume fraction of ossicles, the lesser the flexibility. It is also found that rate of flection varies more among the species than does the degree of flexibility.","437":"The hemal system and its association with the intestine was investigated in P. californicus. Two main vessels run along the length of the intestine; the dorsal hemal vessel is attached to the intestine by small dorsal connections and the ventral vessel lies nearly on top of the intestine. The dorsal vessel beats about every eighteen to twenty seconds, creating a flow pattern of the hemal fluid. The association of the hemal fluid with the intestine was determined by the use of cobalt and latex injections. It was concluded that the hemal fluid flows through concentric folds that face the lumen of the intestine. The transport of absorption of small molecules from the lumen of the intestine into the hemal vessels occurs within a fairly short time -- fifteen minutes -- but the passage of larger molecules is blocked.","438":"Cucumaria curata and C. pseudocurata live and feed in the hydrodynamically stressful environment of exposed intertidal areas. They have been observed to actively feed in flow velocities up to 0.2 m\/s, while allowing their feeding tentacles to bend with the current as flow increases. They suspension feed with peak effectiveness at some optimum low water velocity. Consequently, it is suggested that they incorporate detrital feeding into their food-gathering behavior in order to supplement the aerosol particle capture. However, this too presents mechanical problems. The feeding strategies and mechanisms of C. curata and C. pseudocurata may depend on local water velocities within their different microhabitats, and thus help to differentiate their respective niches.","439":"In a sand dab fin muscle preparation, the electrical and mechanical properties of a fast twitch muscle have been studied. The \"long\" (presumably multiply innervated) fast fibers have resting potentials of -75 to -80 mV and are taken to threshold for contraction (-40 mV) by depolarizing junction potentials. All-or-nothing action potentials are not seen, even when suprathreshold shocks are applied. Twitches are very fast; contraction reaches a peak within 10 ms and relaxation is complete within 20 ms at 18 degrees C. Direct stimulation produces unfused tentant up to at least 200 Hz.","440":"The brittle star Ophiopteris papillosa exhibits an escape response to the predatory asteroid Pycnopodia. Stimulation of Ophiopteris with a tube foot of Pycnopodia evokes action potentials in the radial nerve chord (R.N.C.). Furthermore, recordings of these action potentials are similar both in velocity and amplitude to activity evoked by electrical stimuli of the R.N.C. itself. Also, the axons mediating these action potentials appear to be independent of external Ca++ ions and to run uninterrupted by chemical synapses for at least several millimeters. These axons are probably transmitting sensory information, as tube foot stimulus is a sensory stimulation. In addition, the velocity of action potentials in these axons are about 17 times faster than propagation of the apparent motor output.","441":"Balanomorph barnacles use their cirral net as a sieve to strain food from sea water. Previous investigations have documented activity of the barnacle cirral net, but no study has examined the relationship between barnacle body mass and cirral net size. This study explores this relationship, employing a hydromechanical approach. I found that smaller barnacles have cirral nets with greater area relative to their body mass. An examination of flow through the cirral net shows that this disproportionate area allows flow rates through the net, relative to body size, comparable to those of larger barnacles. In increasing current speeds, barnacles minimize drag of the extended cirral net primarily through vertically withdrawing their cirri. Barnacles do not turn their net edge on to the flow to dodge drag, as earlier reported.","442":"Locomotion was studied in seven species of marine diatoms. A scanning electron microscope was employed to observe frustule morphology, secretion from the raphe system, and trails. Active secretion may be involved in locomotion, but to varying degrees in each species of diatom. It is also possible that secreted trails are, for the most part, just a by-product of locomotion in certain species. Differences in sensitivity to the content of calcium of sea water may indicate less direct use of secretion for locomotion in Nitzschia Longissima and Bacillaria Paradoxa. In addition, drugs such as cytochalasin D and movement in sea water flow seems to confirm the fact that microtubules are not involved and that at least Navicula Vulpina and Nitzschia Closterium use only their posterior portions of their raphe systems during locomotion. Wing like extensions of the frustule used in coupling colonial Bacillaria paradoxa were observed for the first time.","443":"The inflated catch tentacle of Metridium senile behaves independent of the oral disk. Close observation during aggression toward Anthopleura elegantissima reveals clues to its hydrostatic and neural separation from the rest of the animal. In the development of the catch tentacle from regular tentacle, changes in cnidom, musculature, and nerve net are necessary to make it a functional unit.","444":"This study attempts to correlate mechanical characteristics of the tube feet and ampullae in Pycnopodia helianthoides with filmed behaviour of the tube foot-ampulla system in operation. The tube foot-ampulla system is an isovolumetric system. Tube foot wall thickness increases during contraction (E = 0.5 at 54% extension). Tube feet at maximum contraction lose about 88% of their extended volume. The ampullae simultaneously expand in volume by roughly 1110% Longitudinal and circular fibers were found in the ampulla. The maximum strain for these fibers is a s yet undetermined, but what limits tube foot contraction is more likely the maximum contractility of tube foot longitudinal muscles. Tube foot extension is limited by contraction of the ampulla (i.e. restricted by total internal volume of the system). Helically unmapped fibers in the tube foot greatly enhance its extensile capability.","445":"Pacific Sand dabs exhibit postural change when introduced to flow. The rheotaxis and the underlying hydrodynamics are not well studied for flatfish. No known values for lift or drag exist. In this study force transducers were used to measure drag and lift on the sand dab, and corresponding drag and lift coefficients were calculated. The lift is remarkably variant with altered posture and drag is virtually unchanged. It is this four fold lift reduction for head to tail flow that enables the sand dabs to stay in place in currents up to 40% to 50% faster. The sand dab is equally efficient with flows in the opposite direction; this is essential to accommodate the bidirectional surge. A mechanism for lift reduction, or more importantly for increased slipping velocity is proposed.","446":"Videotapes, both in real time and time lapse, were made of moving anemones stimulated by Aeolida papillosa. Close analysis of the videotapes provided a detailed description of the development and progression of locomotory pedal waves in Anthopleura elegantissima. The mean velocity of all anemones studied was 13.6 mm\/hr. A correlation between the movements on the column with that of the pedal disc during locomotion provides a basis for the explanation of muscular systems involved.","447":"Suction recording electrodes were used to stimulate electrical activity in the radial nerve cord (RNC) of the brittle star, Ophiopteris papillosa. In agreement with results described by Tuft & Gilly (1984), the fastest axons (class I) exhibited Ca+2 independence. Slower axons (Class II) depend on Ca+2 for propagation.","448":"The high intertidal limpet, Collisella digitalis, was kept continuously washed by sea water and compared with adjacent individuals under ambient conditions to determine whether prolonged submersion constituted a stress. The osmolality of extracorporeal water and body fluid were monitored over four days, along with the force required to remove the limpets from the rock. The tenacity dropped markedly after nine hours of submersion and by four days was less than 50% of control animals. Increased tenacity was correlated with elevated osmolality of body fluid. It is suggested that C. digitalis behaviorally regulates its body fluid at elevated levels and that prolonged submersion may constitute a physiological stress and set a lower boundary for adults of the species.","449":"The keyhole limpet Fissurella volcano has a sequential escape response to stimulation by tube feet of the predatory starfish Pisaster ochraceus. The response consists of 1) elevation of the shell at the point of stimulation, 2) extrusion of the mantle over the shell, 3) rotation of the shell around the keyhole axis, and 4) rapid locomotion away (fleeing). Limpets on horizontal surfaces have a stronger response to tube feet than do those on vertical surfaces. Responses to sea water which presumably contains a water soluble starfish scent consist of only the mantle extrusion response. Finally, receptors mediating detection of the starfish substance appear to be located on the tips of the mantle tentacles.","450":"The columellar muscle (foot-shell retractor) of the intertidal limpet Collisella digitalis is responsible for the tenacity with which this limpet can hold onto rock substrate in response to mechanical stress (i.e. wave action and predation) (Fretter, 1962). Consequently, desiccation and splash provide great osmotic stress upon this intertidal limpet. This paper describes the varying excitability and \"catch\" characteristics of the foot-shell retractor muscle under varying osmotic stress.","451":"The ability of limpets to exhibit high tenacity in clamping down on rocks for prolonged periods of time is accounted for by a possible catch mechanism. Contractile properties of a preparation of the shell-foot retractor muscle of the limpet Lottia gigantea were investigated using salines of altered ionic concentrations and known muscle effectors (caffeine, acetlycholine, and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine).","452":"Suction capillary electrodes were employed to study the response of the osphradial nerve to electrical and chemical stimulation in the limpet, Colisella limatula. The osphradial nerve was filled with CaCl to identify individual cell bodies and axons along the posterior edge of the osphradium. Chemo-sensitive paddle cilia on the surface of the osphradium were not abundant, if present at all, when observed under the scanning electron microscope. The organ proved to be sensitive to the application of 1M NaCl, 1M LiCl, and 0.5M Na-Gluconate + ASW; it gave a heightened response both in frequency and amplitude of action potentials observed passing along the osphradial nerve (O.N.). A second effect was also observed: the organ was sensitive, on a smaller scale, to 0.6M Sucrose + ASW, and 0.5M NaCl + ASW. The application of these substances resulted in smaller increases in amplitude and frequency, but still visibly greater than that of natural sea water (NSW) which had no effect. Ineffective substances for osphradial stimulation were 0.5M N-Methyl-Glucamine-Cl, light, Pisaster ochraceus tube feet, dacron line, and distilled water.","453":"Experiments were done on the effects of cumulative desiccation on groups of the limpet Collisella digitalis. Results showed that limpets submerged for 0.5 hour between repeated desiccation periods had an increased rate of weight loss after a series of 5 exposures. Limpets submerged for 4 hours between stresses exhibited weight gain during the experiment while 2 hours of submergence resulted in no significant weight changes. When limpets with a desiccation stress of 15% weight loss were allowed to equilibrate with sea water, a period of 2 hours was required for osmotic equilibration of the body fluid. More prolonged submergence of desiccated individuals results in an overshoot of weight recovery at osmotic equilibration. The data suggests that not only does recovery time play an important role in determining the upper limits of the intertidal distribution of C. digitalis, but may also determine the lower limits as well.","454":"The crawling behavior of Lottia gigantea was studied. Animals moved most when 0.8m to 1 m above tidal level with a decline in movement observed by limpets at levels below 0.4m SWL. Animals moved less when the wave induced velocities were higher. Animals adhered less well while crawling, but even then could resist forces nine times those exerted by the observed waves.","455":"Cholinergic receptors controlling iridescence in the iridophores of Loligo opalescens were found to be muscarinic. Selective agonists and antagonists were applied, and responsiveness was measured by a change in iridescence. Carbamylcholine and acetyl-beta-methyl-choline (AMBC) are group A muscarinic agonists that elicited positive response. Effective group B agonists included carbamyl-beta-methyl-choline (CMBC) and oxotremorine. Atropine, scopolamine, and pirenzipine are muscarinic antagonists that effectively hindered iridescence, while tubcurarine, a nicotinic antagonist, did not block iridescence. Agonist groupings are based on their ability to turn over phoshatidylinositol (Phl). The results of these agonists\/antagonists combined with the effect of Li+ and subsequent addition of myo-inositol, show that Phl turnover may be involved. Li+ selectively inhibits a step in the Phl pathway. Li+ was found to decrease iridescence and addition of myo-inositol seemed to cause its reappearance. Ca++ seems to be involved, since addition of an agonist in zero Ca++ sea water did not result in iridescence. Addition of forskolin and caffeine resulted in a decrease in iridescence, implying that high cAMP levels inhibit the response. From this data four receptor models were constructed.","456":"The squid Loligo opalescens exhibits iridescent colors in its third dermal layer through the action of a specific cell type, the iridophore. Although much is known about the neural control of the squids' pigmented chromatophore organs, little is known about the action of the iridophore cells, other than the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is responsible for their activation. This paper sets out to examine the possible mechanism of ACh delivery to the iridophore cells, through an analysis of the activation and spread of iridescence in response to electrical stimulation.","457":"The functional morphology of the suckers of Octopus rubescens were studied by computer models of the acetabulum. The suckers undergo a shape change when contracting, forming a shape that is very resistant to pressure and therefore adaptive for adhesion. However, when the octopus wants to let go, it relaxes the muscles of the sucker and the acetabulum collapses around \"hinges\" to a shape that is not at all resistant to pressure, allowing the sucker to release.","458":"Neuromuscular transmission in the squid is described in terms of the slow and fast fibers characterizing circular mantle muscle. Various potential transmitter substances and antagonists to synaptic transmission were tested by electrically stimulating giant fibers and recording twitch responses of the circular muscle in the presence of the substances tested. Of these, bath application of L-glutamate had an excitatory effect on circular mantle tissue. Antagonists to L-glutamate known to mediate synaptic transmission in other neuromuscular systems had no reversible inhibitory effect on transmission. It is concluded that L-glutamate or a glutamate analog may directly excite the slow circular fiber. The apparently inhibiting action of glutamate on fast fibers innervated by the giant axons may arise either presynaptically or postsynaptically.","459":"Squid boats in the Monterey squid fishery utilize Italian lampara nets that have chains as lead-lines. Two experimental half-purse seine nets are the other type of gear used (spring, summer 1987). Squid egg cases were collected and then damaged with the assumption that gear net lead-lines drag across\/through egg masses and potentially cause an increase in squid egg mortality. Egg cases traumatized mid-way through development experienced a higher estimated percentage of mortality (EPM) than those damaged at early or late stages, for low levels of damage (0 and .21 kg). Misdeveloped embryos occurred most frequently in these mid-stage egg cases. Higher levels of damage (1.2, 2.1, and 3.0 kg) resulted in significant increases of EPM for all three stages. Field work included an observation aboard one of the squid boats that had a half-purse-seine net. Pelagic organisms were 100% of this catch, suggesting that this net did not drag the bottom significantly during this particular set. Variation of developmental stages within three egg clusters suggests that larger egg masses may have variation within. Attempts to restrict fishing above egg masses in mid-stages would be futile because of the mixture of stages within these egg clusters or egg masses.","460":"Data gathered on the escape response of the squid Loligo opalescens, indicates an output through the giant fiber system that arrives to the muscles essentially synchronously (within 2-5 msec.). Further, the first in vivo recordings ever made on the species indicate that the giant fiber system gives a very stereotyped pattern of discharge each time it fires. The giant fibers do not allow the animal to escape any faster, however. It is also observed that giant fiber spikes do not always occur during jetting, that multiple spike discharges are common, and that the number of spikes per jet control the intensity of the jet. Finally, this data suggests a possible course of evolution for the giant fiber pathway.","461":"The common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, is able to exhibit a wide variety of body patterns. Past studies have analyzed the animal's ability to camouflage itself using subjective methods. This study incorporated two objective methods, overall tone analysis and spatial frequency of pattern analysis, to examine how well the animal was matching its background. On its natural background, sand, the cuttlefish matched both tone and pattern. On an unnatural background, such as a uniform gray, one animal matched tone, one matched pattern and one attempted to match both tone and pattern. An analysis combining subjective methods and the quantitative methods described in this paper offer a more definitive method for judging the degree to which the animal can match the surrounding environment in behavioral tests.","462":"To study how the species organizes its time, space, and social structure in a semi-natural situation, a group of six Octopus rubescens were kept in a 5m diameter tank for one month. Observations were made of the win-loss record of each animal in interactions with other members of the group, the time spent by each animal in the different areas of the tank, and the various color patterns displayed by the animals in different situations. A pattern of dominance based on size emerged in which larger animals won encounters with smaller animals. The establishment and defense of a territory by at least one individual in the group suggests territoriality for the species. several color patterns were seen that did not fit previously published reports of typical patterns in the species, and imply that the literature on body patterning in octopuses is neither complete nor absolute.","463":"Cells isolated from optic lobe neural tissue from embryos of the squid Loligo opalescens, develop processes in culture. Growth of neurites depends on pH of the culture medium, nature of the substrate, and presence of medium additives (Fetal Bovine Serum, squid blood, and hemolymph). The optimal conditions identified were pH 7.7, poly-L-lysine substrate, and boive serum. Both whole squid blood and hemolymph depresses neurite outgrowth.","464":"This study examined and compared the forces required to fracture limpet shells. Shells of recently-killed Collisells pelta, C. limatula, C. digitalis, and Acmaea mitra were fractured in an apparatus mimicking the crushing behavior of crabs. In addition, shells of C. limatula and C. pelta were tested for fatigue fracture by repeatedly loading the shells. All species save A. mitra showed increased force needed for fracture as shell thickness increased. No significant differences existed in force as a function of shell thickness among the species nor within each species for forces applied at the length and width of the scar and margin. However, shell size at the width of the scar was significantly smaller than at the other orientations for each species, suggesting that crabs could attack more shells at the scar width than at other places. Also, shells of C. limatula had significantly smaller widths at the scar than the other species, suggesting that perhaps more C. limatula shells are found fractured at the muscle scar because these smaller scar width shells are within the grasping rand of more crabs. Fatigue fracture proved significant (causing fracture below 200 cycles) at force loads above 60% of the predicted breaking force. Above 70-75% of predicted strengths, fracture required less than 50 cycles, indicating that within short time spans crabs could fracture shells without ever exerting a maximum force. Scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the crossed-lamellar layers along the horseshoe-shaped scar layer form almost continuous sheets that allow cracks to fracture the upper portion of the shell cleanly at the muscle.","465":"Nemacysts isolated from Aeolidea papillosa were subjected to different ionic media and their frequency of discharge assessed. Discharge of nematocysts isolated by homogenization could not be induced, suggesting that proper function of the cnidae is at least partially dependent on surrounding tissues. When nematocysts are extruded from intact cerata into ionic media, conditions that inhibit normal contraction of the cerata also reduce nematocyst discharge. Some aspect of passage through the cnidopore or contact with sea water could initiate an intracellular signal in the cnidophage that causes its nematocysts to discharge. A battery of second-messenger inducing systems including forskolin (stimulates adenylate cyclase), TPA (stimulates protein kinase C), calcium ionophore (causes release of intracellular Ca+2 stores), and pH affectors failed, however, to cause nematocyst discharge from isolated cnidophage.","466":"A factor exists in the tissues of Elysia hedgepethi that stimulates the release of photosynthetically fixed carbon from isolated Codium fragile chloroplasts. The factor is labile at high and lower temperatures, non-particular, and predominantly present in the chloroplast-bearing parapodia of E. hedgepethi. It may have a permanent effect on the release of photsynthates without damaging the chloroplasts' photosynthetic capabilities.","467":"This report examines the effect of two peptides, egg-laying hormone (ELH) and alpha bag cell peptide (alpha-BCP), on the growth of regenerating axons in cultured Aplysia californica bag cells. Preliminary findings indicate that these peptides do affect growth rates by causing the axon to erratically grow and resorb after the peptide is added to the bath. Control axons showed steady rates of either growth or resorption, as did most axons prior to treatment with a peptide. Immediately after addition of a peptide the growth rates of many axons became erratic, switching between growth and resorption one to two times in two hours. Axons placed in fresh medium after treatment with a peptide showed much slower swings between growth and resorption. These findings raise many questions about possible feedback biochemical or electrical effects of ELH and alpha-BCP that could be causing such fluctuations on growth.","468":"The technique of freeze-fracture in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy (FFSEM) was developed and successfully used for viewing the developing morphology of the abalone embryo, Haliotis rufescens. The nucleus and intracellular granules\/vesicles could be visualized and changes in the distribution of granules followed during embryogenesis. The FFSEM procedure could be further developed as a research tool, and I present some possible improvements in the procedure.","469":"The shapes and frequencies of action potentials of Coriopsilla albopunctata neuronal soma were studied in artificial sea water (ASW), and ASW solution that were Na+ free, Ca2+ free, with Co2+, or with tretraethylammonium ions (TEA). Action potentials were also measured in ASW solutions containing 67 micromolar forskolin, 1 micromolar chlorophenylthiol cAMP, or 50 nanomolar tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate.","470":"The subpopulation of Collisella scabra found on the shells of Lottia gigantea show significant differences from the general population of C. scabra: population density is ten times less, shell\/body weight ratios are higher indicating slower growth patterns possibly due to limited food availability, and density on the shell increases in areas of high growth wave action possibly due to the faster rate of algal growth in these areas. The limited foraging area on the L. gigantea shell may provide an upper limit to the number of riders it can support, as riders from crowded shells do not lower their metabolic rates. The presence of these riders on the L. gigantea removes the algal coat otherwise found on their shells. This loss of algae, the creation of the C. scabra's home scar, the added weight of the riders, or the drag differences created by the riders cause no apparent advantage or disadvantage to the L. gigantea. While these results are in no way comprehensive, they provide a background knowledge for further studies of the species interactions.","471":"A series of computerized limpet models were generated and their stresses analyzed using finite element analysis to determine how a variety of shell morphologies would effects stress distributions and magnitudes in limpet shells. Various morphologies can affect stress distribution and magnitude. Large height to diameter ratios, lowered apices, and apices positioned in the anterior third of the shell were all determined to be particularly advantageous morphologies in reducing overall stresses on the shell (in terms of percent of breaking stress). In addition, shells with increased thicknesses at the apex and below the muscle scar were shown to reduce stress concentrations in these areas. These findings support data collected by David Lindberg (1981) who showed that of the 20 California limpet species the majority have medium to medium-high profiles with apices in the anterior one-third of the shell.","472":"Elysia hedgepethi were starved until free of chloroplasts. As feeding resumed, re-establishment of the animal-chloroplast symbiosis was monitored and found to rebound to normal levels after five to seven days of feeding on Codium fragile. E. hedgepethi fed seven days on a diet of isolated C. fragile chloroplasts did not accumulate chloroplasts intracellularly to an significant extent.","473":"In order to illustrate the usefulness of the dorid nudibranch Doriopsilla albopunctata for electrophysiological studies, maps of pleural ganglia were made and gross cellular responses of autothythmic neurons to applied neuroactive peptides and amines were observed.","474":"The gastropod Calliostoma canaliculatum demonstrates a violent escape response to the seastar Pycnopodia hellianthoides. The entire escape mechanism is a high complex series of reactions the culmenates in the secretion of a noxious yellow substance from the animal's hypobranchial gland. The extent to which C. canaliculatum will go to escape from Pyncopodia without using the secretion demonstrates a general reluctance to use the method if it can be avoided. The source of this excretion appears to be endogenous to C. canaliculatuam and does not come from its diet. Once secreted, the snail needs between 4-7 days to regenerate the substance to its full capacity, but four days appears to be sufficient for the effectiveness of the substance to reach its full strength.","475":"After 15 minutes, 11% of the photosynthate fixed by isolated chloroplasts of Codium fragile was released to the control medium. The percentage released remained constant over a five hour period. Chloroplasts incubated in homogenates of C. fragile did not release a greater percentage of fixed carbon over chloroplasts incubated in the control medium. Extracts from Elysia hedgpethi that were starved for 16 days also did not induce the release of photosynthate from isolated chloroplasts. Further experiments were done using E. hedgpethi that were starved for 22 days and then re-fed C. fragile until their green color was restored (7 days). Homogenates of the re-fed slugs again showed no increase in the percentage of fixed carbon released. In one experiment using extracts from Aplysiopsis smithi, 52.3% of the photosynthate was released from isolated chloroplasts, over 2.5 times the percentage released to the control medium.","476":"The pleural ganglia of Doriopsilla albopunctata were mapped, allowing for exploration into the effects of various neuroactive substances on particular types of molluscan cells. Using a current clamp, we studied those cells that demonstrated autorhythmic firing characteristics -- either beating or bursting. Two amines, Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamine, and one peptime, FMRF-amide, were applied onto the ganglia and the resulting gross voltage changes were recorded.","477":"While feeding on the sea anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima, the nudibranch Aeolidia papollosa secretes large amounts of a highly viscous mucus. This mucus elicits a swelling response in the column of A. elegantissima. A elegantissima lean away from areas on which much is applied. This swelling is though to be part of A. elegantissima locomotion. The mucus does not appear to inhibit nematocyst firing in A. elegantissima, instead it actually stimulates firing. In the case of Aeolidia mucus, the anemone's response is likely that of defense, not of predation. Chemical characterization of the Aeolidia mucus shows that it has a molecular weight greater than 12,000 daltons, that it is not heat stable and that it contains several mg\/ml of protein.","478":"Different methods of inducing spawning in the gastropod Acmea incessa were investigated. No reliable method was found that could be used as a generalized technique for mollusc spawning. To stain the chromosomes of the eggs and developing zygotes, I used a method that required preliminary fixation in carnoys solution followed by DAPI stain. The developing stages of the zygote chromosomes immediately after fertilization up until the first cleavage are documented.","479":"The noxious yellow slime secreted by the marine snail Calliostoma canaliculatum contains mostly small constituents (less than 12Kd) that are heat stable and partially hydrophobic. There are at least two bioactive fractions in the slime. One has a molecular weight of approximately 700-800 daltons, and the other contains the characteristic yellow color.","480":"Marine invertebrate embryos can concentrate amino acids from dilute solution against gradients as steep as 10^6. I report here that Notoacmea incessa embryos can concentrate leucine and methionine 200 and 400 times, respectively, over ambient levels after 15 minutes incubation. Transport increased at 3 hours post-fertilization with maximal rates for the first 36 hours of development occurring by 12-18 hours post-fertilization. A Lineweaver-Burk analysis of leucine uptake revealed a Km of 1.262 uM and a Vmax of 4.9 X 10^(-14) moles\/embryo\/15 minutes. This Km value is comparable to that observed for other marine invertebrate embryos, but the Vmax value is 10-100 times lower. Approximately 70% of the leucine transported by the embryo was incorporated into protein, as compared to 15% for methionine. Several possible explanations for the different rates of incorporation are presented.","481":"I investigated the settlement of B. glandula in response to several potential chemical cues. Results of field experiments indicate that this barnacle uses the presence of conspecific barnacles and possibly a subtidal congener as cues when choosing an appropriate settlement site. Gastropod mucuses did not elicit the settlement response. It is important to note, however, that these results are only preliminary, as they are based on limited replication and that the true pattern may only emerge when many replicates are used.","482":"Electrophoretic techniques were used to analyze the genetic variation of Sebastes paucispinis and S. goodei. Three types of variation were examined: variation between the muscle and liver tissues of an individual, between individuals of a species, and between species. Six enzymes systems were used: phospholgucomutase (PGM), glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), esterase (EST), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), sorbital dehydrogenase (SDH), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). GPI, IDH, and MDH showed variation between tissues within individual fish. Allelic variation was detected at GPI-B in S. paucispinis. MDH proved to be the only distinguishing enzyme between the two species; all other isozymes had identical electrophoretic mobilities in both species.","483":"Starch electrophoresis has shown that the natural populations in the Monterey Bay area of Sebastes atrovirens (Kelp Rockfish) and Sebastes chrysomelas (Black and Yellow Rockfish) vary little within the species in the pattern of enzymes examined. In Sebastes atrovirens two out of six enzymes showed a genetic variation: Glucosephospate Isomerase (Gpi-B) and Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (Idh-A). In S. chrysomelas two rare alleles were found in the Phosphoglucomutase (Pgm-B) locus. Calculations of gene frequencies show that 95.7% of all investigated specimens express identical phenotypes within S. atrovirens and 96.4% within S. chrysomelas were found to be identical in the studied loci.","484":"In the present study, brief exposure to glutamate was found to cause cell death of neurons cultured from the brain of adult marine surfperch, Cymatogaster aggregata. A dose-toxicity study suggested an ED-50 of 100-500 uM glutamate for a 5 minute exposure. A toxicity versus age in culture study showed that glutamate receptors may be expressed as early as 24 hours in culture. A dose response study on Day 2 in culture indicated that glutamate neurotoxicity (GNT) is cumulative; the higher the glutamate concentration used the greater the cell death. Some neurons survived short exposure to glutamate. This resistance could be due to a lack of glutamate receptors on neurons from certain regions of the brain. Cerebellar neurons exposed to glutamate, for example, showed no deviation in viability from the control percentage.","485":"I studied the pattern changing abilities of the Speckled Sanddab by acclimating sandy patterned fish to a rocky substrate and rocky patterned fish to a sandy substrate. Both rocky and sandy fish demonstrated the ability to alter their pattern to match a novel substrate. After 8 days of acclimation, rocky fish matched sand better than sandy fish matched rock. Whether this was the result of all fish becoming sandier after removal from the field is not certain. There may be a cost to maintaining a rocky morphology. If so, it would be more difficult for a sandy fish to gain a rocky morphology than it would for a rocky fish to gain a sandy morphology. Sandy fish showed a greater fidelity to their original substrate than rocky fish, indicating that a lower ability to effectively match another substrate limits the freedom a fish displays in choosing a new substrate.","486":"Work on olfaction in fish is significant in two major ways. First, characterization of effective attractants obviously would impact on commercial fishing. Second, examining basic olfactory mechanisms in fish could further our general understanding of sensory mechanisms in vertebrates. We examined the olfactory system in three abundant rockfish of the Sebastes genus in order to initiate such a program of research. We discovered extremely show conduction velocities of in the olfactory nerve of 15 to 25 cm\/sec, and extremely small axons, even compared to other fish. Our studies raise questions about the organization of these axons in the olfactory nerve. Finally, tissue dissociation proved effective in isolating single receptor cells in high yield. Future research on olfaction in Sebastes rockfish looks very promising.","487":"A study of scaling of the pectoral fins in the genus Sebastes was conducted using 12 fish from a wide variety of species and ranging from 15.5 grams to 2891.0 grams. Measurements were made of angular velocity and an average drag coefficient. The angular velocity was found to be independent of body mass and was 7.85 radians per second. The average drag coefficient was 0.0096. Measurements of total wet surface area and body length were made and were plotted as functions of body mass. The results show that the body of the fish is scaling isometrically. Measurements of pectoral fin area, radius, large muscle length, small muscle length, and muscle mass were made and plotted as functions of body mass. The results show that the pectoral fin is scaling isometrically. A model of a single pectoral fin power stroke of a fish was constructed. The model was used to generate velocity time plots for six hypothetical fish. The results suggest that the maximal velocity scales isometrically.","488":"Daily movement patterns of and pool fidelity in the intertidal fish Clinocottus analis was determined. Individuals showed a high degree of fidelity to a specific tidepool and the majority appeared in their pools on an every day or every other day basis. However, almost 25% of the time the cottids sheltered at some unknown location at low tide. It was also found that individuals of this species do not stay in their tidepools at high tide and are shown to be able to return to their pool of first capture over considerable distances.","489":"To examine what factors influence surfperch distribution and behavior, I made observations of a protected nearshore area off Point Cabrillo, California at different times of the day and tidal cycle. Within the study area, there was substantial niche diversity in the members of the family Embiotocidae among different habitats of similar depths. The black surfperch were found in the most protected area of the study and in highest densities at low tide. The striped and pile surfperch were equal in abundance in all habitats. The rainbow surfperch were seen in small schools on sandy bottoms. The reef surfperch were the most abundant species of Embiotocid: they inhabited a shallow nearshore region and concentrated in large schools at the entrances to channels during low tide. Niche diversification seems to be a relevant way of viewing dynamic fish distributions and an important factor to be considered in choosing methods for conducting population studies.","490":"The flatfish Citharichthys sordidus (Pacific Sanddab) is a bottom dweller dependent on camouflage and quick escape response to protect it from danger. In an attempt to determine the nature of the substrate's role in the quick liftoff of the sanddab from the ocean bottom, an experimental fish lifted off alternately from a porous and a solid substrate. The sanddab displayed similar displacement, velocity, and acceleration vectors in both x- and y-directions when lifting off from either substrate. The similarity of movement on both substrates indicates that a ground effect, or force caused by hydraulic flows redirected by the nearby solid substrate is of little consequence to the sanddab as it lifts off from its substrate. I suggest three possible mechanisms, each independent of substrate, that may contribute to the liftoff of the sanddab.","491":"This study describes the tidepool environment along the shore of Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University and relates it to the population and distribution of the cottid species Clinocottus analis and Oligocottus snyderi. The relationship between the cottid mass per tidepool volume and the percent of oxygen consumed by cottids in a tidepool is approximated by the equation %O2 = 0.0023 * (mass\/vol)^(-6.07) where oxygen is expressed in grams, but algae seems to be the primary consumer of oxygen. It is suggested that a potential problem for fish is having algae in the same tidepool as a means of protections and as a competing oxygen consumer. In addition, tidepool height, volume and range in temperature are discussed as they relate to the cottid population.","492":"Extracellular recordings of Mauthner (M-) cell activity was carried out in the senorita wrasse, Oxyjulis californica. Criteria for identifying the Mauthner cell have been satisfied in our experimentation. We observed a C-start tail flip behavior caused by both antidromic and orthodromic stimulation. electrophysiological recordings from the medullary area though to contain the M-cells reveal a short-latency, all-or-nothing spike of large amplitude. Preliminary experiments on the effects of an as yet uncharacterized cone snail toxin on M-cell activity were performed.","493":"The kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) hovers at a range of angles to horizontal using slow movements of its pectoral and caudal fins. It adjusts its buoyancy using a swimbladder, which increases the volume of the fish without increasing its mass and thus reduces its net density. I found that the center of buoyancy, the point at which the force due to the swimbladder acts, is anterior and ventral to the center of gravity. This creates rotational instability. I formed a model to examine the effects of the buoyant force, the force due to gravity, and the forces of the pectoral and caudal finds on the rotational and vertical translational equilibria of the fish. I found that the net torque is much more sensitive to changes in the angle of the fish than is the net vertical force.","494":"Small polydisperse circular DNA was isolated from the brain of the senorita. Size determination ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 kb with the absence of significant mitochondrial contamination. Small polydisperse circular DNA was also isolated from tissue of the spleen; however, no circular DNA was detected in the liver.","495":"This paper is devoted to characterizing the electric organs in the Pacific electric ray, Torpedo californica. These rays do not show signs of conditioning to electric stimuli. It is possible to record the amplitude of the voltage generated by the rays' electric organs and to record post-synaptic potentials from isolated living electric organ tissue. The neuromuscular junction potentials are capable of following nerve stimulation at frequencies in excess of 80 Hertz. These isolated column recordings show that facilitation occurs in the neurotransmitting mechanism that produces the shock.","496":"Although there have been many studies on the relationships between certain fish and sea anemones in the tropics, very little is known about the fish-anemone interactions in the colder waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. After a seven week investigation in Monterey Bay, I found that none of the fish observed will acclimate to the tentacles of either of the intertidal sea anemones Anthopleura xanthogrammica or Anthopleura elegantissima, although Clinocottus analis will rest on the base or column of either. I also found that Oxylebius pictus, as well as other rock dwelling fish, will acclimate to Corynactis californica. The acclimation process takes approximately 3-5 days, depending on the amount of contact between the acclimating fish and the anemones, and the amount of previous contacts with the anemones by other fish. There are two mechanisms involved in the acclimation process. First, through repeated contact, the fish picks up mucus from the anemones and adds its to its own mucus layer. This causes each anemone to recognize the acclimated fish as a part of itself and prevents the fish from stimulating the anemone's chemoreceptors for nematocyst discharge. Secondly, the anemones become habituated to contact by the fish.","497":"Rates of oxygen depletion per biomass were determined separately for four groups of organisms: fish, invertebrates, healthy algae, and necrotic algae. Rates of oxygen addition per biomass were determined for healthy algae at varying degrees of solar irradiance. These rates were incorporated into a computer program and used to predict oxygen levels in tidepools with known amounts of biomass of the above groups of organisms. The model was calibrated using input values from one pool, and tested using values from two other pools. The model predicted oxygen levels reasonably close to actual field values for night deletion and morning addition, but predicted a continuous rise in tidepool oxygen during the afternoon, when actual tidepool oxygen concentrations tend to level off. When manipulated over a midnight to noon time course, the model highlighted the importance of algae to both addition and depletion of oxygen in tidepools. Other factors that showed significant effects on ambient oxygen levels included invertebrate population, day length, and local topography.","498":"This paper explores three aspects of the Pacific electric ray Torpedo californica: the basic anatomy of this fish, how the torpedo insulates itself from its own shock, and whether the torpedo's electroreception can be used as a tool for learning. Using anatomical observations and skin resistance measurements, I set out to determine whether the torpedo's skin was different over the electric organs and non electric organ areas and how the torpedo insulates itself. I could find no difference in appearance, texture or color from the electric organ to non electric organ. I did, however, find that there are many more layers of connective tissue over and under non electric organ areas than over the electric organs. Furthermore, I measure the dorsal skin to have roughly twice the resistivity as ventral skin. I believe that the other important insulation tactics are use of cartilage to protect the brain, heart and nerves, connective tissue to protect peripheral nerves, and placement of muscles as far from the electric organs as possible. I have also described the placement of the ampullae of Lorenzini and applied Pavlovian conditioning techniques using the ampullae. During the time we tried to condition the torpedo, it was not responsive.","499":"The neuromuscular junction of the Pacific Sand dabs was studied. Neither fast nor slow muscle fibers in the fin muscles of sand dabs produce action potentials. Muscle activation by indirect stimulation could be inhibited with D-tubocurarine (curare), tetrodotoxin (TTX), and GVIA omega-conotoxin. This indicated some similarities in the neuromuscular system of sand dabs compared to other vertebrates. Motor nerve and synaptic transmission are sensitive to sodium and calcium channel blocks, and acetylcholine is likely to be the neurotransmitter, as suggested by the curare sensitivity of neuromuscular transmission. However, direct stimulation of muscle fibers could be continued after the neuromuscular transmission had been blocked. Although they do not produce action potentials, the muscles do produce end plate potentials. A single end plate potential has proved adequate to produce a muscle twitch.","500":"The egg capsule sheath of the squid Loligo opalescens is an acellular matrix 1-2mm thick which contains roughly 100 thin striations in layers parallel to the capsule surface. In this matrix is suspended a dense culture of bacteria in one to five layers. Its probable source is the accessory nidamental gland.","501":"This model of primary production in Monterey Bay predicts weekly phytoplankton growth under given environmental conditions. Growth values are then combined with equations for fallout, advection, and nutrient recycling to calculate each week's phytoplankton biomass. The model's predictions, especially for production, compare well to actual measurements for the Bay. The model also predicts a small winter phytoplankton bloom resulting from nitrate accumulation. This bloom has been observed in the field. With additional complexity, this simulation could provide input terms for future Bay models.","502":"Using data collected by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in Monterey Bay and employing stepwise multiple regression techniques, this study develops several equations that estimate primary productivity for Monterey Bay. The most significant equation, using integrated chlorophyll, photosythetically active radiation (PAR), and surface phaeopigments as variables, explains 77% of the variance in primary productivity measurements. Another equation explains 70% of the variance, using the two variables, PAR and surface chlorophyll + surface phaeopigments, which are both measurable by remote sensing. Tests of these equations on another MBARI data set, which includes oceanic sampling, demonstrates the possible applicability of these equations on a regional scale.","503":"The biochemical genetics of an intertidal barnacle, Tetraclita rubescens (Darwin, 1854), were examined at four sample sites along the coast of central California. Examination of the allelic frequencies at four polymorphic loci indicate that gene flow between subpopulations is either currently high or was so very recently. Not all sites, however, appear to exchange migrants equally. The samples from the Moss Landing site appear to be closely related to each other and other evidence suggests that Moss Landing may be quite isolated from the more southern populations. Point Conception does not appear to be a major barrier to gene flow, and migration between Pacific Grove and Port Hueneme, three hundred miles away, appears to be greater than migration between Pacific Grove and Moss Landing, only twenty miles away. A population of Semibalanus cariosus (Pallas, 1788) was also studied, and found to be almost indistinguishable from the Tetraclita populations at all four polymorphic loci scored. This indicates that strong selection pressures may be maintaining these allelic frequencies, and the polymorphisms may be older than the species themselves.","504":"The properties of fluid dynamics present interesting problems for marine life, dictating that the locomotion of slow moving animals are controlled by the viscous forces in their environment. This study looked at medusan locomotion in adult and young Eutonina indicans. Medusae, unlike many other small marine organisms, maintain the same relative shape and method of locomotion as their size spans 4+ orders of magnitude during their growth phase. It was found that the locomotion of the young medusae was dominated by drag. These juveniles accelerate rapidly to overcome the viscous forces inhibiting their motion, but decelerate just as rapidly as thrust tapers off. Medusae swim by a jet propulsion mechanism, in which they produce thrust by ejecting fluid backwards. The adults contract and accelerate slower, but move more efficiently and further than the young due to their larger size. Over a similar time span and number of swimming cycles the young only managed to move 1\/3 of the relative distance of the adults.","505":"The cost of locomotion is defined as the energetic cost of transporting one unit of body mass one unit distance. Previous experiments reported that the cost of locomotion in swimming fish of sizes .001 to 1 kg follows a common trend: as body mass increases, the cost of locomotion decreases. In this study, costs of locomotion were calculated for seven gill sharks, Notorynchus cepedianus, of weights 10.3 to 51 kg. The costs calculated followed the trend previously reported. The sharks used in this study represent the largest swimming fish for which the cost of locomotion has been calculated and demonstrate that the cost of locomotion trend holds for animals upward of 50 kg. Average swimming velocities were also calculated in order to compare them to a cost-optimization model based on the hypothesis that an unmolested fish will swim at a velocity that requires the least energy expenditure. In this study, swimming velocities varied from .31 to .44 m\/s over a total body length range of 1.34 to 2.21 m. These velocities are lower than those predicted by the cost-optimization model and those observed in two other shark species.","506":"Tegula was shown to eat gametophytes of the alga Macrocystis pyrifera under both laboratory and controlled field conditions.","507":"Measurements were made of the force required to break the barnacle Balanus glandula while the animal was attached to four different rocky substrata. Force was exerted on the barnacle normal to the substrate surface and the dislodgement force was recorded. In general, force was not proportional to barnacle size and barnacles were stronger on stronger rocks. The results are discussed in the context of the environmental hydrodynamic forces encountered and the population genetics of B. glandula.","508":"This paper describes dilution experiments used to estimate grazing rates of microzooplankton on phytoplankton. The experiments, essentially following the guidelines prescribed by Landry and Hassett (1982), were conducted at three sites in the equatorial Pacific (7 N 132.5 W, 0, 125 W and 2 N, 110 W) in May 1990. Grazing estimates (0.62\/day - 0.05\/day) predict that 31.9 - 87.8% of the phytoplankton biomass is grazed daily. NaH14CO3 incorporation measurements were conducted and surface phytoplankton filters taken in order to test the non-density dependent assumption. Density independent growth was observed.","509":"Remote operated vehicle (ROV) dives in the Monterey Bay Canyon revealed the ubiquitous presence of an unidentified, orange-pigmented mysid. An analysis of videotape footage taken on numerous ROV dives during a one year time period was done to examine the distribution, habitat, and behavior of the mysid. Samples were also taken using a suction sampler on the ROV and taxonomic and observational studies were performed on these samples. It was found that the mysid may be a new species and a proper identification continues to be pursued. A preference for soft sediment was also found in the mysid, and it is felt that this may be a reflection of available habitat type and feeding requirements.","510":"The modulation of the central pattern generator for swimming in Melibe leonina by serotonin is the focus of this paper. Changes in behavior and neuronal firing patterns were monitored during the application of serotonin in order to elucidate how a neural circuit can be modified by a chemical transmitter. Behavioral observations indicate that micromolar concentrations of serotonin cause an increase in swimming frequency immediately after application in a whole animal preparation. Recordings from Interneuron 1 in the swimming circuit show that serotonin causes a decrease in burst duration and an increase in both instantaneous frequency and spikes\/second\/burst immediately upon application. These three parameters are all consistent with a transient acceleration and tightening of the burst firing pattern of Interneuron 1. After washout, a second application of serotonin to the same ganglia results in no significant changes in the firing pattern of Interneuron 1. Similar results were seen in a whole animal preparation; after 1-3 applications of serotonin no changes in swimming frequency occurred upon additional application. Two possible mechanisms are given to explain the effects of serotonin. One explanation is that serotonin works as hormones affecting all the cells within the swimming neural circuit. The other explanation is that serotonin works as a neurotransmitter at specific synapses between the cells of the circuit.","511":"Mitochondrial DNA from the livers of adult rockfishes were examined for differences in restriction fragment lengths. After the mitochondrial DNA from kelp rockfish, blue rockfish, black rockfish, and other rockfishes was isolated, it was digested with seven different six-base restriction endonucleases, run on agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, probed with radioactive mitochondrial DNA, and the resulting autoradiographs examined for polymorphisms. We found that all the enzymes showed differences among the three principal species, and that only the kelp rockfish displayed polymorphisms within the species. This method might be used to identify larval rockfish. The results also have interesting implications for the population genetics of the kelp rockfish, S. atrovirens.","512":"My study of Anthomastus ritteri has led to an establishment of its distribution in Monterey Bay, a description of its feeding behavior, responses and endogenous cycles of anthocodia, and a diet analysis. When densities were calculated according to geographical location, depth, and habitat type, it was found that the highest concentrations of Anthomastus ritteri occur at the Canyon Wall Meander site, at a depth of about 350m, and on exposed rock faces. White individuals are more common towards the south while pink and red ones are the only ones seen at the northernmost locations. Two distinct feeding behaviors are used by the species depending on whether it is ingesting large or small particles. Anthocodia retract both in response to mechanical stimuli and in an endogenous cyclical pattern of 27 hours length. Fecal analysis suggests that they are ingesting mainly sand particles and detritus.","513":"Two competing models have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which a sperm activates an egg at fertilization. One postulates a receptor while the other relies on fusion as the primary means of signal transduction. This study looked for a soluble activation factor which could act as a diffusible messenger between the fused sperm and egg. S. purpuratus sperm were lysed with 1% Triton to bring all solubilizable proteins and factors into solution. In a second set of experiments, sperm were permeabilized with hypotonic solution and then suspended in an extraction buffer of high salt and pH 8, designed to bring only soluble cytoplasmic elements into solution. Both sets of extracts were microinjected into eggs and activation was monitored by looking for the rise of the fertilization membrane. Under the various conditions used in this study, no soluble fraction from sperm activated the eggs when microinjected.","514":"It was demonstrated that the addition of 10nM speract to gametes of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus dramatically increases fertilization in standard laboratory conditions and under the effect of turbulence. Such an increase in fertilization has not been observed by other researchers; the difference in results is likely due to variations in experimental conditions, in particular egg suspension (personal communications from D. Garbers, N. Suzuki, and V.D. Vacquier). Speract's mechanism of action remains unresolved; this paper suggests that there is a low-affinity receptor on the sperm tail to which speract binds, possibly causing changes in sperm metabolism.","515":"Some of the behaviors of the marine nudibranch Melibe leonina have been described, such as feeding, \"galloping\", the crumple response, and its fascinating swimming behavior (Hurst, 1968; Thompson). However, a new behavior, the shrug response, has been noticed and is described here. It was noted via visual observations that this behavior habituated quickly and was inhibited during swimming and locomotion. The purpose of this study was to observe and describe the properties of this behavior, trace it neuroanatomically, and find its relation to other motor behaviors. Results of behavioral manipulations and electrophysiological recordings showed that the shrug response is part of a behavioral hierarchy and, because it is mediated through one, central pathways, would be good for studies on habituation.","516":"Harbor seals were found to sleep in the shallow waters near their haul-out. In the majority of cases a seal slept in a prone position amongst the surf grass. Sleep was most frequently observed at mid-tide levels. Pups were observed in aquatic sleep only at the water's surface. Rumbling is a highly stereotyped behavior involving both vocalizing seals (rumblers) and non-vocalizing attendants. The low-frequency vocalization is performed by males only and in a localized portion of the study site. Attendants, also males, participate in the behavior by situating themselves alongside the vocalizing seal so that their heads are in close proximity. It is suggested that this behavior is linked to reproductive activity.","517":"This paper presents a method of determining the relative abundance of the siphonophore species Apolemia uvaria in relation to depth in the Monterey Bay Canyon. This species of phynosect was found to exist intact at depths below 250 meters. Further, density increased with depth below this level. In addition, it was found to be more abundant in habitats close to the canyon wall as compared to one mile off the wall. The unique resources of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and its remote operated vehicle (ROV) were used to study and collect these organisms. A gut content analysis and description of the general feeding pattern of A. uvaria was also conducted with samples collected at depths of up to 500 meters. It was shown to have a novel feeding strategy in comparison to other siphonophores studied. In particular, its numerous, large gastrozooids allow for flexibility in prey size and percentage of gastrozooids containing prey.","518":"A study of the activity patterns of Collisella scabra showed that the most prevalent movement occurred during periods of submergence with no difference between daylight and darkness. Furthermore, studies showed that cephalic tentacles are not essential to the homing ability of this species, but they do play a role in the ability to detect the directionality of mucous trails.","519":"Six serotonin antagonists, cinanserin, methiothepin, spiperone, metergoline, ketanserin, and methysergide were all found to delay the first two divisions of sea urchin embryos. Three serotonergic agonists, DOI, RU24969, and phenyl biguanide were also found to delay cleavage, although more weakly than the antagonists. Cleavage delays caused by 10 uM metergoline and 10 uM ketanserin were reversed by serotonin. Serotonin alone was found to speed up cell division over controls. Cytological studies showed the serotonin antagonists metergoline, ketanserin and methysergide delayed karyokinesis as well as cytokinesis.","520":"Interneuron 1 of the Melibe swimming CPG was studied with both intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological techniques. By varying the concentrations of Calcium and Magnesium in the extracellular saline, an oscillating voltage that happened in the absence of action potentials was observed in Interneuron 1. These results were taken to indicate that Interneuron 1 is driven at least in part by a wave of extracellular excitation.","521":"Videotape footage taken on remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives from 3\/09\/89 to 5\/14\/91 was used to examine the distribution and behavior of the upper mesopelagic shrimp Sergastes similis in Monterey Bay. A quantitative method of determining relative density was developed and used to show that the abundance of S. similis is significantly higher at a site in the vicinity of the Monterey Canyon wall as compared to one mile from the wall. Vertical distribution of the dielly migrating shrimp also appears to shift upward with the slope of the canyon. Studies with horizontal transects showed densities at 100m from the wall not to significantly differ from those in the water column. However, density increased significantly within 50 m of the wall to a highest relative value at the water column\/slope interface. Behavioral studies showed S. similis to play a role in the trophic structure of the slope benthic community. Overall, canyon topography was determined to have important influence on S. similis distribution and behavior.","522":"The development of sea urchin eggs in a 6.7 pH buffer causes slowed progression through mitosis with eventual arrest in metaphase and sustained levels of Histone H1 Kinase activity. A pH sensitive step or a number of steps must exist in the pathway for inactivation of MPF or histone H1 Kinase, probably by effecting the destruction of cyclin. The developing eggs were arrested at metaphase because the signal for progression through anaphase, MPF inactivation, never appeared.","523":"Chemical cues from Macrocystis and mysid are capable of triggering behaviors in the nudibranch mollusc, Melibe leonina. The behaviors elicited are appropriate to the stimulus. (i.e. Melibe locomote in response to Macrocystis, and exhibit feeding behavior in response to mysid.) These behaviors are not seen when the animals are in an isolated environment or are stimulated solely by touch or vision. Furthermore, Melibe exhibit the ability to integrate chemical cues. While neither brine shrimp nor kelp alone will inspire them to feed, brine shrimp combined with the smell of kelp provides the threshold stimulus necessary to begin feeding. Rhinophore ablation indicates that the rhinophores are the chemoreceptive organs responsible for the detection of these cues.","524":"Unfertilized sea urchin eggs, centrifuged into nucleate and enucleate fragments were activated by ammonia and time-lapse videotaped on alight microscope to record movements of the membrane surface. These fragments, unable to divide, exhibit \"wiggling\" and contractile movement that corresponds in time with the normal first and second mitotic cycles, peaking in intensity with expected cytokinesis. Movement then declines in intensity, corresponding in time with normal interphase. Cytoskeletal isolations performed at times of intense movement show astral organization of microtubules in both nucleate and enucleate fragments.","525":"Rolling is an aquatic interaction between two seals which involves head to tail somersaulting, mounting, and twisting and writhing movements as the seals bite each other. It has been alternately explained as male\/female mating behavior, play, and dominance establishment; however, it has only been studied from land. This underwater study found that rolling is almost exclusively male, and probably serves to establish dominance and mating privileges during the breeding season.","526":"Strong evidence for the compartmentation of arginine in both unfertilized and fertilized sea urchin eggs was obtained by comparing the arginine content of an extract obtained from permeabilized eggs with the arginine content of an extract produced by extracting the same eggs with 105 degree heat. A significant portion of the total arginine of the egg was found in the heat extract. This suggests that some arginine is sequestered within slowly-exchanging compartments.","527":"Free-swimming Sepioteuthis lessoniana hatchlings were videotaped during both feeding and strobe flash sessions. Analysis showed that while feeding the peak instantaneous velocity obtained by the hatchling is twice as great and the peak acceleration is 50% greater than during an escape response to a strobe flash in which only the giant axon is used. Behavioral measurements of mantle radius made with video were used to compute jet thrust and compare performance with varying patterns of motor neuron activity in the restrained hatchling. The coordinated, adult like pattern of giant and small fiber use resulted in mantle contractions and jet thrusts that were always greater than contractions and thrusts produced by giant-only or small-only responses. Thus, evidence strongly suggests that hatchling Sepioteuthis use the giant fiber in feeding attacks.","528":"Astrogliosis following injury to the mammalian central nervous system is accompanied by increased synthesis of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the lack of regeneration. In order to extend studies of GFAP expression in relation to injury in taxa of higher regenerative capacity, we chose Octopus rubescens as a model system. We used a polyclonal anti-human GFAP in conjunction with immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry techniques applied to optic lobes of the brain and to peripheral axial nerve cords in the arms. Animals were also studied before and after lesion to the axial nerves that contain ganglionic regions of neuronal and glial somata. In uninjured Octopus, Western blots with both tissue sources revealed a single protein band (140kD). Pre-absorption of the antibody with purified human GFAP eliminated this band, which is larger than the 48-51 kD protein found in vertebrates. Immunostaining of fixed and sectioned material from axial nerve cords showed that anti-GFAP preferentially stained cellular regions. This pattern is distinct from that produced by anti-neurofilament, which stained primarily neuropil and axons. Studies were also carried out following injury, immunoblotting revealed an increased level of the 140 kD band. Experiments on other cephalopods were also carried out. In uninjured Sepia officianalis, Sepioteuthis lessoniana, and Loligo opalescens, the 140 kD band was not detected by Western blots with optic lobe proteins. This product was obtained, however, with axial nerve material from Sepia. These results (i) indicate the presence of a GFAP-like protein in the nervous system of cephalopods, (ii) show that increased protein levels accompany injury in the peripheral nerve cords in Octopus, and (iii) suggest that the protein may be associated with glial cells.","529":"In this experiment I compared the toxicities of Exxon Corexit 7664, 9550, 9527, and 9580, SLIK-A-WAY, Nokomis 3-F4, and Nutri-Bio 1000, with and without 1 gram of crude oil, using the splash pool copepod Tigriopus californicus as a test organism. Investigating T. californicus as a test organism revealed that males are more sensitive than females to change, that the organisms' survival is inversely proportional to the amount of crude in their environment, and that they survive longer in filtered water than in the tide pool water when no outside air is available. These preliminary studies resulted in the final sample of 5 female T. californicus (3 with eggs), in 3ml tide pool water, in a 12hr light\/dark cycle at 15 degrees C, with and without 1 gram crude oil to test the cleaning reagents.","530":null,"531":"Iridophores in Sepiateuthis lessoniana were studied by light microscopic and ultrastructural techniques in order to identify the component of the cell responsible for iridescence. The thin film interference was considered as a possible explanation for iridescence. This hypothesis was rejected when the source of iridescence was isolated and identified as a diffraction grating. These results suggest that the dorsal iridophores could vary their degree of iridescence by changing the conformation or spacing of the grooves making up the grating.","532":"The submersible ROV of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute provided video footage of crab-anemone interactions and was used to document a symbiotic relationship. Chorillia longipes, and Corallimorphus appear to inhabit a common depth range and pattern of distribution in the Monterey Canyon, and 81% of the corallipmorphs viewed were hosts to crabs. Chorillia longipes were found between 298 meters and 650 meters, and the corallimorph was seen between the depths of 306 meters and 506 meters. The corallimorph appeared in highest concentration at North Wall and were virtually absent south of Point Joe. Video observations suggest that corallimorph reproduces both asexually and sexually. The crab gains food and possible protection from their host anemones, and thus the relationship may be best described as commensalism.","533":"The impact of the introduced mudflat grazer, Batillaria attramentaria on the ecosystem in Elkhorn Slough was studied by building cages to exclude the snails from plots of sediment. Sediment samples were collected from the exclosures and from controls areas where the snails were present. These samples were then analyzed for chlorophyll a concentration as a measure of diatom productivity. The high variation within the environment, both spatially and temporally, obscured the effects of the snails. Therefore, the population dynamics of the diatoms must first be elucidated before the effects of snails can be determined.","534":"The nudibranch mollusc Melibe leonina has been shown to be useful for neurophysiological studies due to its relatively simple nervous system. As a precursor to understanding nerve pathways for behavior lies the study of the behaviors themselves. Spontaneously occurring behavior of Melibe was observed and analyzed to determine patterns and predictability. Nine individually occurring behaviors and copulation made up the behavior catalog that was used. Results showed that there is an exponential transition rate out of the feeding mode of Melibe, that there is a correlation between time spent feeding and size of the animal, and that the patterns of behavior can be predicted by a stochastic, one-step transitional probability matrix. Two behavior loops are also present in the Melibe which may demonstrate a hormonal change between them. The predictability of behavior can assist electrophysiological studies with live animal preparation by allowing the researcher to predict and prepare for certain behaviors.","535":"A multi-xenobiotic resistance p-glycoprotein transport activity linked with the multi-drug resistance phenomenon isolated in human tumor cells has been found in various marine invertebrates. Individual cells, assessed by fluorescence microscopy, possess a Rhodamine B efflux activity which can be inhibited by Verapamil, a p-glycoprotein transport inhibitor. In addition, western blot analysis indicates the presence of a protein of a similar molecular weight to the mammalian p-glycoprotein. This activity appears to be a filter feeding lifestyle-linked phenomenon and was found in Urechis caupo eggs, Ascidia ceratodes eggs, and Mytilus californianus gill and mantle tissues. The recognition that marine invertebrates exposed to man-made and natural noxious substances may possess a multi-xenobiotic resistance activity is essential to our understanding of organismal detoxification mechanisms and the biological impact of pollution and could be useful in risk assessment for regulatory policy.","536":"An ecological survey noted nine species of limpets on Tegula funebralis. The only adult limpet found on this host was Lottia asmi which is the most abundant of any epizoic gastropod in three different habitats at Pacific Grove, California. Other juvenile, commensal limpets may temporarily use the microhabitat of T. funebralis as protection against desiccation until their shell size is big enough to withstand the stress on rock surfaces. T. funebralis also offers small limpets some protection against heavy wave action. L. asmi was observed to be significantly larger in the wave exposed habitat. Possibly fewer predators of L. asmi allow for greater survivability in this area or the increased amount of food on T. funebralis' shell permits faster growth. L. asmi did occur on Pagurus, although not as frequently as on Tegula. The lack of correlation found in this study between commensal and host size suggests that transfers occur before food limitation. Laboratory observations of the movement of L. asmi revealed that the mean number of days this limpet remains on a snail or hermit crab is less than one. Transfers between substrates by L. asmi occurred most often during high tide and the number of transfers during the day was higher than at night.","537":"Prompted by reports that the application of micromolar concentrations of serotonin to whole animal preparations of the nudibranch mollusc Melibe leonina increases swimming frequency, an attempt elucidate the specific location and mechanism by which serotonin affects the swemming circuit was undertaken and the first steps have been successfully completed (Morris*, 1990). An immunohistochemical method involving a polyclonal antibody to serotonin and the Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) for its visualization has revealed probable endogenous serotonin in numerous locations in the cerebral, tentacular, pedal, and pleural ganglia of Melibe. Preliminary analysis of stained whole mount brains indicates staining on ganglionic and cellular levels, and there is evidence of serotonergic fibers in numerous nerves. Of primary interest is the finding of a cluster three stained cells in the immediate vicinity of a key element of the swimming circuit: Interneuron 1.","538":"Factors influencing the distribution pattern of different ages of hauled out harbor seals were studied for a 5-week period in Spring 1991. Particular emphasis was placed on the impact of substrate characteristics on the observed age distribution. The seals in this area utilize irregularly- shaped offshore rocks for haul out. Aggressive behavior was almost completely absent in this area and seals were never observed battling over haul out space. Substrate features which were examined included: distance to an escape channel: % total and individual algal cover; size of hauling ground; and degree of incline to reach the hauling ground. These features at least partly resulted in the observed segregation of ages as adults were limited by the size of the hauling ground, while subadults and juveniles were limited by the % algal cover and degree of incline. Social organization may be an additional influence on the age-structured distributions, but the short term of this study prevented any extensive investigation into the social structure of this population.","539":"Spermatozoa from the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus are shown to lose the ability to fertilize soon after dilution. Acrosomal reaction studies, using both nascent and senescent sperm, demonstrate that sperm are becoming insensitive to egg jelly (the natural inducer of the acrosomal reaction [4]) with time. Although unable to respond to the jelly stimulus, aged sperm suspensions yield a high percentage of acrosomal reactions when treated with Ca++ ionophore A23187. Hence, impaired potency arises from the inability to \"receive\" the egg jelly ligand and initiate a Ca++ influx. Possible causes of this acquired ability are discussed.","540":"Many sessile marine invertebrates exhibit a common suite of adaptations, including life histories with both a sexual and an asexual phase, clonality and\/or coloniality, and the ability to distinguish between clonemates and non-clonemates. These characteristics, together with limited, or philopatric, dispersal patterns in free-swimming larvae, are all present in the common tunicate Botryllus schlosseri. This organism presents an ideal model for the study of the problems in population genetics posed by complex life cycles, because the genetics of its fusion-rejection reaction are well-understood, and it is relatively easy to collect and maintain in the laboratory. I present here the results of experiments using both histocompatibility tests on live Botryllus oozids in the laboratory, and arbitrarily-primed PCR, as tools for population genetics research. My work with Botryllus oozoids involved testing the rates of fusion and non-fusion between pairs of offspring obtained from wild colonies containing fertilized eggs. I compared fusibility rates for the offspring of near-neighbor colonies to those for offspring of non-neighboring colonies, and found that there was a significantly higher rate of fusion between offspring of neighbors than between offspring of non-neighbors. My work with arbitrarily-primed PCR was aimed at developing the technique for further work in Botryllus; I was able to detect genetic diversity based on differences in the patterns of amplification products obtained with different DNA samples. I also describe some preliminary conclusions as to the most effective conditions for arbitrarily-primed PCR reactions using Botyrllus DNAs.","541":"Pannychia moseleyi is a commonly found benthic organism living at depths greater than 400 m in the Monterey Bay canyon. Observations in the laboratory have shown that, upon tactile stimulation, Pannychia produces blue-green spiral and quasi-circular waves of bioluminescence over the entire body surface except the podia, papillae, and tentacles. Video analysis showed dispersion in traveling waves, i.e. the wave velocity at a point depends on the time elapsed since the previous wave passed that point. Annihilation was observed to occur when waves collided. This leads to the conclusion that the mechanism of bioluminescence behaves as an excitable medium with a refractory period of <= 0.5 seconds. There appear to exist regions on the body surface which are incapable of bioluminescing. These banded unexcitable zones are arranged diagonally with respect to the horizontally oriented animal.","542":"Marine mussels Mytilus californianus and Mytilus edulis, hardy invertebrates resistant to pollution, were found to possess a multi-xenobiotic resistance mechanism analogous to multi-drug resistance (MDR) found in resistant mammalian tumor cell lines. This MDR-like efflux pump may provide defense against natural toxins in the aquatic environment. An assay using the fluorescent dye rhodamine B was adapted to measure MDR activity in Mytilus sp. gill tissue in vivo. Four pieces of evidence support the existence of a multi-xenobiotic resistance in Mytillus sp.: 1) accumulation of rhodamine B is sensitive to known inhibitors of MDR, such as verapamil; 2) verapamil inhibits an efflux pump; 3) Western blot analysis shows the presence of a protein immunologically related and similar in molecular weight to mammalian MDR P-glycoprotein; and 4) the Mytilus sp. efflux pump is sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of rhodamine B.","543":"Although most previous research has not been successful in getting mature, differentiated neurons to express exogenous DNA, this has reportedly been done in a variety of neuron types in Aplysia californica using a RSV promoter\/enhancer sequence. This study attempted to express the lacZ gene from Escherichia coli in the giant fiber lobe (GFL) neurons of squid using this promoter\/enhancer. No expression of the B-galactosidase enzyme was detected in GFL cells or the Aplysia neurons when the cells were injected with the plasmid, but B-galactosidase activity was assayed in neuroblastoma cells. A probable reason for non-expression of the plasmid in the Aplysia may be ineffective injection techniques. the non-expression in the GFL cells may be due to either the injection process or the inability of the cell to be induced by the RSV promoter. However, one additional factor involved in expression of exogenous DNA was found. In looking at another study done on GFL cells, it was found that heat shock increased expression of Na channels. The exact mechanism that is affected to produce this effect from endogenous genes is unknown, but the effect heat shock may have on exogenous DNA expression cannot be ignored. And given the differences between the Aplysia and the squid systems, more studies on the effect of heat shock on these systems must be done before any definite conclusions can be drawn.","544":"The ability of calcium to turn on the calmodulin-activated enzyme NAD kinase was tested at different stages in the development of sea urchin embryos during the first 24 hours after fertilization. It was found that NAD kinase is a stable enzyme and that its calcium-dependency does not change throughout development. Tests on NAD kinase from eggs grown in emetine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and actinomycin, an inhibitor of RNA transcription, revealed that the enzyme is neither translated or resynthesized during the first twenty four hours. A calcium sensitivity curve was plotted for the enzyme and correlations between the critical concentrations of free calcium for the activation of NAD kinase and the actual calcium levels in the eggs are discussed.","545":"In situ instruments report a daily periodicity in fluorescence (f) and beam attenuation (c) in the ocean. The daily changes are hypothesized to result from changes in phytoplankton physiology. To determine the relation between f, c, chlorophyll (chl), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), time series measurements were made on cultures of phytoplankton which were exposed to different light conditions. F normalized to chl (f*) varied inversely to PAR. c* displayed daily changes that did not correlate to PAR. The f* response is well above experimental noise and its amplitude is two times as strong as the in situ signal. The c* response is not significantly outside of the experimental error, and its amplitude is within the range of the in situ signal. Absorption (a) was also measured. A* did not correlate to PAR or time, but steadily decreased as cultures grew older. I conclude c* varies due to b* (scattering per chl.) with a circadian rhythm, and f* varies in response to PAR. This is consistent with in situ data. Further, I present what is believed to be the first reported empirical method to measure chl from both f and PAR.","546":"Potential chemical cues in squid ink were identified and quantified using high-performance, reverse-phase, liquid chromatography (HPLC). Primary amines in squid ink were conjugated with the fluorescent compound ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA). Upon separation by the column, l-dopa and dapamine were detected by an end-column fluorometer. Crude ink was manually extracted from the dissected ink sacs of freshly-killed Loligo opalescens collected from Monterey Bay, California. Protocols for preventing the oxidation of the active compounds were developed, thereby allowing for the storage of ink for later analysis. Fresh ink was never analyzed. Standard curves were established for both l-dopa (r^2 = .967; CV of slope = 8.2%) and dopamine (r^2 = .939; CV of slope = 9.0%). These standard curves were used to transform the integrated peak areas from the HPLC analysis into absolute quantities. Ten ink sacs, collected from 8 adult males and 2 adult females, were used to create four discrete samples for analysis. For l-dopa we report a mean concentration of 1.40 (+\/- 0.43) nanomoles per milligram of extracted ink. For dopamine we report a mean concentration of 0.70 (+\/- 0.14) nanomoles per milligram of extracted ink.","547":"Few observations have been made on Atolla, a bioluminescent deep-sea coronate scyphomedusa. With the use of a remotely operated vehicle and a specially designed plankton-kriesel, Atolla in the Monterey Bay have been videoed in situ, captured, and observed in the lab to learn more about their behavior. A characteristic response to stimulation with light is described called the light reflex. The light reflex consists of a number of quick pulses and\/or the medusa turning belly-up. Once in the belly-up position, Atolla rarely reacts to any further stimulus. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy were used to take a preliminary look at the nematocyst composition of the trailer tentacle compared to the many short tentacles.","548":"Currently, the important pollock fishery in the Bering Sea remains unregulated because of the lack of information regarding its population genetics. PCR amplification and direct sequence analysis provide fisheries biologists with a high resolution method for detecting genetic differences within a species and thus for assessing stocks. The mitochondrial displacement loop (D-loop) gene was targeted for direct sequence analysis due to its elevated rate of mutation. We developed specific PCR methodology for D-loop amplification that involved a superior DNA extraction method using the detergents dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and a specific pair of primers that amplify the D-loop gene, flanking tRNA genes, and surrounding portions of the 12S rRNA and cytochrome b genes. Overall, we sequenced 200 bases of the surrounding portion of the cytochrome b gene from an Kamchatka Island pollock sample. During an interspecies comparison, 68% of these bases correlated to the same portion of the cytochrome b gene in the shark.","549":"Carbon-fiber microelectrodes were used to electrochemically measure concentrations of oxidizable neurotransmitters, serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The electrodes consisted of a carbon filament surrounded by a glass capillary tube. The carbon filament was connected to a patch clamp amplifier to set the filament at a certain voltage and measure current flow, which increased during oxidation. This was done both with a triangle wave, cyclic voltammetry, and a set potential of +.5 and .6V, amperometry. Calibration curves were done with known concentrations of both epinephrine and serotonin in vitro. In vivo recording were performed in Pleurobranchea pedal ganglion and N1E-115 Neuroblastoma cells. Epinephrine behavior was close to theory with a one to one relation between increase in I and [Epi], but the response to [5-HT] was not as strong. The electrodes measured 90 uM (400 pA by amperometry) release of serotonin from the Pleurobranchea pedal ganglion. Readings were also taken from N1E-115 cells which showed 1 to 100 uM (1.6nA) norepinephrine release after stimulation with carbachol, a non-oxidizable analog of acetylcholine.","550":"The decline of natural stocks of the commercially harvested red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, has led to land-based cultivation. To date, there has been little research on the effects of domestication upon the genetic diversity of this species. In this study, protein gel electrophoresis was used to estimate the extent of inbreeding and\/or genetic drift within cultured and natural red abalone populations. The present analysis of nine populations indicates that there are significant differences between the genetic compositions of the Santa Barbara 1992 population, believed to be an introduced population, and the natural populations, but only slight differences between the cultured and natural populations. This has implications for the success of the California abalone enrichment programs of 1979-1980. Additional results of this study have relevance for abalone aquaculture. The genetic drift analysis of one of the cultured populations indicates that not all of the abalone used for each hatchery spawn had actually contributed to the production of offspring.","551":"Solmissus spp., a narcomedusa found commonly throughout the midwater region from the surface to 1000m may play an integral role in the midwater food web. Foraging, feeding and digestive studies in situ and in the laboratory indicate that Solmissus has adapted to living in a low prey density environment by behaviors which increase prey encounter time and area. These behaviors include extending tentacles and swimming while foraging; resuming foraging while still in the ingestive process; eating a very large range of prey sizes; and ingesting more than one prey item at a time. Thirteen Solmissus spp. were collected using a Remote Operated Vehicle in the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. In the laboratory, these specimens were kept in tanks and fed various shallow and deep water flora and fauna. In the laboratory, Solmissus preyed on Beroe abyssicola and Nonomia biyuga, which they digested in 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.","552":"This paper discusses the distribution of the egg case of the cat shark Apristurus brunneus in Monterey Bay. There is a focus on depth distribution as well as preferred substrate for egg laying. In addition to the distributional findings, this study has pointed out further questions, eg. is the number of egg cases in Monterey Bay declining? Also addressed is the possibility of predation of the egg case occurring in nature.","553":"Autorhythmic bursting pacemaker cells have been hypothesized to function by a calcium-coupled system. Bursting pacemaker cells in Aplysia californica, the R15's and LQB's were flushed with saline solutions containing .01, 10, and 60 nM concentrations of Ca2+. I found that the burst duration is affected by the extracellular concentration of Ca2+, shortening in high Ca2+ and lengthening in low Ca2+ solutions. This is consistent with an increase and a decrease in C current (calcium dependent potassium current) activation. The mechanism behind the interburst interval, however, is still unclear. The changes in its duration point to a homeostatic mechanism.","554":"Eight genes in Macrocystis pyrifera code for the FCP protein. Each gene has similar coding regions but very different noncoding regions (dissimilar sequences and sizes). From this gene family three genes, 2A, 4B, and 4C were studied. Gene specific primers were made and challenged with positive results. These primers were used in PCR reactions to make gene specific probes. The gene specificities of the probes were tested using Southern Blot Analysis concluding with supporting results. A light regulation experiment using RNA obtained from incubated kelp blades which were analyzed on a Northern Blot using the radioactive gene specific probes was conducted but its results were ambiguous.","555":"Bacteria were observed on the embryos of Pachygrapsus crassipes, Pagurus samuelis, and Hopkinsia rosacea. Strains that grew in culture were isolated, and were identified as Pseudomonadaceae and Entereobacteriaceae. There were eighteen isolates: eight from P. crassipes, six from P. samuelis, and four from H. rosacea. None of these strains showed anti-fungal activity against Lagenidium callinectes. The role of the bacteria isolated from P. crassipes embryos were studied in greater detail. Embryos treated with penicillin G, which was effective against seven of the eight strains of bacteria, had a higher mortality rate, and a greater likelihood of being infested with other microbes. This finding suggests a defense role for the bacteria.","556":"Endogenous rhythm study on deep sea organisms has been very limited in the past. In this light, the suggestion by Riise of a circadian or circatidal rhythm in the soft coral Anthomastus ritterii becomes extremely interesting. The purpose of this study was to verify this hypothesis as well as to entrain the creatures to a controlled rhythmic stimuli. The data collected does not verify that hypothesis, but interestingly enough, does point to an endogenous rhythm. The colonies appear to be quite periodic, but follow a highly individual cycle, with period times ranging from 16.8 hours to 38.8 hours. The cycle seems to be unperturbed by controlled environmental queues such as light, feeding, and mechanical disturbance. Study of a juvenile with a radically shorter period of 7.7 hours suggests important changes in development with respect to this periodicity.","557":"Benthocodon pendunculata is a deep-sea benthopelagic medusa found abundantly in Monterey Bay and Carmel Bay, which has been virtually ignored since its original description (Bigelow, 1913). Recent observations from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), working in the Monterey Submarine Canyon, reveal that the medusae live primarily near the deep-sea floor and may be potential predators of benthic or benthopelagic crustaceans. This study investigates the gross morphology of the medusae, tentacle types, and nematocyst types. Phase contrast microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to detect morphological differences between the inner and outer tentacles and also revealed two nematocyst types previously undescribed in the literature, the modified-aspirotle nematocyst and the modified-stenotele nematocyst. Gut analyses of medusae yielded copepods, amphipods, foramniferans, pycnogonid, and other unidentified organisms which show that the medusae are feeding on benthic and benthopelagic organisms. Based on the results of this study, a model of tentacular function in feeding medusae was generated.","558":"The marine worm Urechis caupo exhibits a multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) similar to multidrug resistance (MDR) in mammalian tumor cells. Urechis oocytes from their developing stages in the coelomic fluid to at least the two day larval stage possess a membranous protein of 160 kD that is immunologically related to the mammalian MDR P-glycoprotein of 170 kD. However, activity of the 160 kD protein is absent in developing coelomic oocytes but is detected once the oocytes reach the storage organs as immature oocytes. Further studies are necessary to investigate the causes for the activity increase of the MXR protein at this stage.","559":"Phragmatopoma californica is a marine annelid that sheds sticky eggs. The adhesion of the eggs was found to be dependent on trace levels of calcium. Transglutaminase inhibitors dansylcadaverine and putrescine prevented or lowered stickiness, indicating the involvement of transglutaminase cross-linking in the adhesion process. Other substrates that prevented stickiness were protease and ethylenediamine. The egg surface adhered to a polylysine coat, indicating a negatively-charged membrane. Adhesion does not appear to follow the model system of Mytilus edulis, so P. californica may present a new system of adhesion in water.","560":"Pannychia moseleyi is a deep sea holothurian found at depths from approximately 500 meters to 3000m in the Monterey Bay Canyon. The bioluminescence in Pannychia moseleyii has a complex dynamic pattern spread throughout the epithelium, but absent from the tube feet, papillae, and tentacles. The waves observed were greatly varied, but can fit into three general classifications -- spiral, circular from a point, and travelling. The basis of bioluminescence in Pannychia appears to be intracellular and microscopic, and shows strong evidence for being passed in an excitable medium such as a nerve net. The strongest evidence for the coordination by a nerve net comes from transection studies.","561":"Organisms on rocky intertidal shores must withstand water velocities of 10-20 meters\/second (Denny 1988, Carrington 1989, Jones and Demetropoulos 1968) and accompanying accelerations of 400 m\/s^2 (Denny et al. 1985, Gaylord et al. in press). Because drag and accelerational forces increase with area and volume respectively, the bigger a species is, the larger the forces on it become. Egregia menziesii is an unusually large alga that lives in the intertidal region amid violent water motion. Here, I address how E. menziesii interacts with flow. A hydro-mechanical model is used to predict the magnitude of the forces on E. menziesii in various conditions and for various plant sizes. Based on measurements of the strength of E. menziesii, an intact average-sized plant's survivorship in the range of predicted wave forces is found to be nearly 100%. However predation and entanglement with other plants can lower an individual's chance of surviving a severe storm to nearly 70%. E. menziesii's strap like shape is found to be necessary for accommodating the distribution of tensions along the plant's stipe and for reducing drag.","562":"Nineteen square yards of W.G. Hewatt's (1934) ecological transect in the intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station were replicated in order to determine changes in populations of intertidal invertebrates. Forty-two invertebrate species showed an appreciable change in number between the two studies. It was hypothesized that some of the changes might represent shifts in species' range due to a temperature increase which was observed in historical sea-surface temperature data for the intertidal zone at Hopkins. The species were divided by their listed ranges into northern, southern, and cosmopolitan categories to determine any correlation between changes in a species' population and its listed geographic range. Changes in the physical habitat, introduction of the predator Haematopus bachmani and Enhydra lutris to the area, increases in seagull populations, and increases in Macrocystis were also considered as factors driving the changes in some of the species. When these factors were accounted for, increases in 8 of 10 southern and decreases in 4 of 5 northern species were observed, suggesting a temperature dependent species shift.","563":"In N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, observations made with time-lapse photography under bright field microscopy provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind two distinct phenomena: neurite initiation and cell death. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of neurite initiation occurs upon elevation of intracellular concentrations of cGMP by use of a membrane permeant derivative: dibutyryl cGMP. Data are consistent with a model describing cGMP production by nitric oxide activation of guanylyl cyclase as at least in part responsible for cGMP-mediated neurite initiation both in the absence and presence of carbachol stimulation. The neuroblastoma cells exhibit a novel form of neuronal death when exposed to carbachol. deaths occur upon contact of a growing neurite from one cell on to the soma of another; in some instances the cell that dies is the target of the \"contacting neurite,\" while in others the owner of the contacting neurite dies. A proposal is offered concerning the involvement of nitric oxide in this event.","564":"Tigriopus californicus exhibits a heat shock response under thermal and osmotic stress. At least three heat shock proteins (hsps) are induced under conditions of thermal stress at 30.1 degrees Celsius. At least 2 hsps are induced by T. californicus in 50% and 2x instant ocean, the latter causing greater hsp induction. The proteins identified under thermal stress were 2 hsp 60's and one hsp 70. The proteins identified under osmotic stress were 1 hsp 60 and 1 hsp 70. In both conditions, hsp synthesis occurred rapidly, mostly under one hour. All analysis of protein induction was done by autoradiography using L-[35S]methionine and was supplemented by Western analysis. Identification of hsps in T. californicus will provide the basis for further study of hsps in invertebrates and elucidate the role of hsps in the stress response.","565":"Neurological research on escape response in the squid Loligo opalescens has raised the possibility that active feeding behavior post-hatching stimulates development of adult-like control over the use of giant axons in both escape and attack jets. This study provides behavioral evidence to support that hypothesis, by comparing the attack behavior developed by hatchlings raised on prey which required an active pursuit and capture strategy with that of hatchlings raised on slow-moving prey.","566":"Pannychia moseleyi exhibits waves of bioluminescence under neural control. The mean speed of propagation of the luminescent waves is 16.8 +\/- 8.8 cm\/s. Excitation propagates in the radial nerves and in the nerve net, with respective conduction velocities of 31.9 cm\/s and 7.1 cm\/s . The bioluminescence acts as an excitable medium; however, the dispersion relation predicted by excitable media theory between conduction velocity and period is not observed. Pacemakers controlling the bioluminescence have periods between 0.33 and 0.69 s. The activity of these pacemakers may be controlled by an inward calcium current because the period of the pacemaker increases in high concentrations of magnesium.","567":"Ubiquitin is a small protein-binding protein that is found in all eukaryotes. It displays a high degree of conservation among organisms. It is involved in many cellular functions including DNA repair, cell cycle control, and the stress response. There are several classes of ubiquitin-protein ligating enzymes that are involved in the ubiquitin system, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBC's), confer specificity to the ubiquitin by selecting which proteins to tag with ubiquitin. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 2 UBC's have been shown to be induced by heat shock and are involved in the stress response. Tigriopus californicus, a copepod abundant in the high splash pools of the California Coast, displays an ability to tolerate wide environmental fluctuations in temperature and salinity. DNA and RNA were successfully isolated from T. californicus. Three genes coding for ubiquitin were found. One ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene was found and sequenced (UBCT1). The homology between the UBCT1 gene and yeast UBC4 and UBC5 is extremely high, indicating that UBCT1 expression may also be induced during heat shock and play a role in the stress response.","568":"Messenger RNA encoding GFLN1, the sodium channel proposed to exist in the giant axon of the squid, was detected in embryos of Loligo opalescens. PCR analysis and RNAse Protection Assay both confirm the initiation of GFLN1 mRNA expression at stage 25 of embryonic development. The level of GFLN1 mRNA expression was found to increase rapidly at stage 27, which immediately precedes giant axon function. Expression levels progressively increased during late development of stages (28-30) which coincide with increased speed of the escape response.","569":"Using immunoblotting and enhanced chemiluminescence techniques, heat shock proteins of molecular weight 60kD and 70kD were identified constitutively in Tigriopus californicus under control conditions of 19 degrees Celsius. Hsp 60 was induced during separate experiments under conditions of increased temperature and increased salinity concentrations. Western analysis could not definitively identify induction of hsp 70 during heat shock or salinity shock. This study serves as the basis for further study of heat shock proteins in marine organisms.","570":"This experiment was designed to study different aspects of development and behavior of the vesicomyid clams in the cold seeps of the Monterey Canyon. It consisted of two parts, a behavioral study done using time-lapse video and a study of the effects simulated cold seep conditions had on the gametes of the clams. The first portion of the project, the behavioral study, only allowed for developmental progress and gave inconclusive results, so it was discussed in this paper beyond pertinent information in the introduction. The second portion of the project and the focus of this paper consisted of testing the egg buoyancy of the eggs of different species. The majority of conclusive data comes from C. pacifica, although some conclusions were available from the vesicomyid species known as \"Sharpbutt\" also. A significant discovery in regards to condition of the eggs was that a mucous cloud released with the eggs during experimental spawning and dissecting procedures greatly changed results when compared to those of clean, free eggs. The implications this information holds for egg survivorship and a specific environment of embryonic and larval development remains speculative.","571":"The echiuroid worm Urechis caupo is one of the many marine invertebrates that is able to live and reproduce in a polluted environment. One proposed explanation for this worm's resistance to pollutants is the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanism, whereby a protein in the cell membrane pumps a wide variety of moderately hydrophobic compounds out of the cells. This protein is analogous to multidrug resistance (MDR) in mammalian cells which provides mammalian cells with multidrug resistance to chemotherapuetic agents. These data support the role of MXR as a protective mechanism for marine invertebrates, suggest bioassays for pollutants, and propose that the phenomenons of hormesis and multixenobiotic resistance are related.","572":"The heat shock response is a universal phenomenon in which an environmental stressor causes an animal to produce large quantities of heat shock proteins or HSP's. These proteins are thought to protect the cells from the damaging effects of stress, allowing the organism to recover from the shock and survive. In this study, the heat shock response was studied using the western blotting technique in the benthic sea cucumber, Psolus squamatus. An initial screening of the proteins from an unshocked specimen revealed a total of five proteins that cross-react with the anti-heat shock protein 60 antibody. P. squamatus generally lives in temperatures between 4 degrees C and 7 degrees C and in an ocean water salinity of 33.2 ppt. heat shocking the animals along a temperature gradient revealed that heat shock protein 60 production can be induced at 13 degrees C, but protein synthesis appears to shut down and protein degradation may occur at super-ambient temperatures such as 20 degrees C. Death occurs at 22 C. Salinity shock was at 10 g\/L above and below the natural salinity of 33.2 g\/L. Results of the salinity shock appear a little more ambiguous and further study needs to be done before any conclusions are drawn.","573":"This study focused on the reproduction and development of three articulate brachiopods to enable rearing of young in the lab which could later be used for transplant studies in the deep sea. The three brachiopods studied are Terebratulina crossei, Laqueus californianus var. vancouverensis and Laqueus californianus. Specimens of each were collected from Monterey Canyon using a ROV and maintained in chilled aquaria. Fertilization was accomplished by stripping gonads from both sexes, macerating them through Nitex and combining them in vitro. Successful fertilization of both T. crossei and L. c. vancouverensis was achieved at 5 degrees C and embryos were raised to larval stage.","574":"This study investigates the chemoreceptive abilities and escape responses of Tegula brunnea, T. montereyi, and T. pulligo to common predators. The predators studied were the sea stars Pisaster giganteus and Pycnopodia helianthoides, and the crab Cancer anternnarius. T. brunnea and T. pulligo could both detect Cancer from waterborne olfactory cues. Furthermore, all three Tegula species took a signficantly longer time to emerge from their shells in Cancer water as opposed to Pisaster or Pycnopodia water. T. brunnea exhibited a flight response in the starfish waters but not in Cancer water. T. pulligo exhibited a flight response to Pycnopodia, but not to Pisaster or Cancer. T. montereyi displayed a flight response in Pisaster water but was more stationary in Pycnopodia and Cancer waters.","575":"Juvenile squid, Loligo opalescens, face a great challenge in catching quick, elusive copepods. The master of copepod capture, an acquired ability, develops progressively past a basic attack strategy, through various strategies which facilitate capture, namely the \"arm-intercept\" and the \"tentacular grab.\" Squid raised exclusively on easily captured Artema nauplii and introduced to a copepod diet 40 days after hatching could not master copepod capture and died, presumably of starvation.","576":"Two groups of Octopus rubescens were maintained and observed for space usage in a 3.6 sq. meter tank for one month. Composite regional foraging patterns developed. A pattern of social interactions and body postures reflecting territorial dominance was also observed. Two octopuses were seen to be dominant within identifiable home ranges. These data suggest that aggressive, dominant O. rubescens may defend a territory.","577":"Zosteric acid (p-sulphooxy cinnamic acid) was studied for its role as a non-toxic antifouling agent. Cypris larvae of B. amphitrite were used to study the effects of the compound on larval chemotaxis, mobility, and settlement. Zosteric acid (ZA) elicited no chemotactic response from the larvae and therefore it does not appear to inhibit settlement by deterrence. ZA and sodium acetate, a weak acid with a similar pKa, did both cause larval immobility, possibly acting as weak acids and changing intracellular pH. Both pH neutralized (8.0) and unbuffered ZA were shown to inhibit settlement by up to 30%. Because the presence of microbial films can act as settlement cues for further fouling by both larval invertebrates and algae, ZA's effect on bacterial attachment was also investigated. Both zosteric acid, a sulfated phenolic ester, and p- coumaric acid, an unsulphated analog of ZA, were found to suppress bacterial attachment. Therefore, it can be concluded from this study that the sulphate moiety is not the necessary component for inhibiting bacterial adherence. The effects of ZA were also assayed on the attachment of sperm to the egg in the fertilization of the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Litichinus pictus. It was found that the sulphate group on the ZA is necessary for the inhibition of fertilization. Another fertilization experiment, in which Protease was used to remove the vitelline layer of the egg, showed that ZA may inhibit fertilization by binding to the egg receptors on the vitelline layer, thus blocking sperm from attaching. In conclusion, it should be noted that ZA has a wide variety of effects and more than one mode of action. Multiple mechanisms seem to be involved, both individually and synergistically, in producing ZA's antifouling effect.","578":"Pagurus samuelis is found consistently higher than Pagurus granosimanus in the rocky intertidal of China Point in Monterey Bay. The adequacy and availability of Tegula shells to P. samuelis and P. granosimanus was studied to investigate the possibility of competition for shells as a mechanism of maintaining tidal height segregation. The investigation was done in three portions: a mark and release study of live snails to directly find the rate of supply of new shells, creating a shell adequacy index using crab weight and shell diameter, and a comparison of the shell adequacy of P. samuelis and P. granosimanus where they co-occur and occur separately. Although the mark and release study yielded no mortality after six weeks, data from the shell adequacy index suggests that large P. samuelis and P. granosimanus are not shell limited. The interspecific competition for shells was not significantly different from intraspecific competition, and therefore does not play a major role in maintaining tidal segregation.","579":"The nature of the association between the symbiotic bacteria and the accessory nidamental glands of the female squid, Loligo opalescens, was investigated using light, fluorescent, and transmission electron microscopy. The accessory nidamental glands of three female squids at varying stages of sexual maturity were observed and two possible differences noted as functions of maturity. Two observations were significant: 1) the association between the gland and the bacteria might vary at different stages of sexual maturity, and 2) the morphology of the bacteria differed depending on the stage of development. Three hypotheses have been proposed that may explain the observed trends. The first suggests the varying association is a cyclic phenomenon during which the bacteria grow according to a characteristic lag, exponential, and stationary phase situation. The second explanation is that the gland secretes varying amounts of product during maturation which dictates the proximity of the bacteria to the gland. The third theory is based on the idea that distinct species of bacteria colonize the accessory nidamental gland at different developmental stages.","580":"In the Monterey Bay, there are two types of Anthopleura elegantissima: symbiotic and aposymbiotic. Symbiotic anemones have a relationship with unicellular dinoflagellates. Algae are singly bound in membrane vacuoles within the endoderm of the anemone. Aposymbiotic anemones do not have this association and probably do not have the metabolic functions that are part of the symbiosis. Because of the differences in these anemones, the hypothesis was established that there were protein differences between aposymbiotic and symbiotic anemones. Qualitatively, both membrane and soluble proteins in both anemones were analogous. Quantitatively, however, disparate soluble protein quantities of sizes 106 kD and 14 kD were found. The 14 kD protein was more prevalent in the symbiotic anemone based on optical density readings taken from a scanned gel (0.292 vs. 0.057 Trace Optical Density x mm); the 106 kD protein had a greater expression in the aposymbiotic anemone (0.25 vs. 0.17). Further testing is needed to identify these proteins.","581":"Two intertidal hermit crabs, Pagurus granosimanus and P. samuelis, were studied at the Hopkins Marine Station. The two species demonstrate definite zonation along the intertidal, but intraspecies differences are not known. Past studies have shown that shell characteristics such as damage, fouling, and adequacy have varying influences on the reproductive success of females. Ovigerous females, non-ovigerous females, and males were examined at three different locations. The study of the distribution and the shell utilization of each of the hermit crabs revealed that males were more predominant than females. Non-ovigerous females were more common than males. Shell fouling had no effect on the shell utilization by ovigerous, non-ovigerous and male hermit crabs. Ovigerous females were in shells with less damage. Shell adequacy assignments showed that females were more likely to be ovigerous if they occupied smaller shells than the preferred size calculated from a shell adequacy index. Clutch size was minimally correlated to other measurements.","582":"The supralittoral harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus is subject to a wide variety of external stressors. Animals were collected from splash pools at Mussel Point, Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA during May 1994 and flash frozen at poolside to examine the expression of HSP60 heat-shock proteins. No correlation was found between HSP60 expression in animals and splash pool salinity, suggesting acclimation through osmoregulation. Differential expression of HSP60 between T. californicus populations, however, was noted.","583":"The feeding behavior and prey selection of the deep-water calanoid copepod Gaussia princeps was observed under three different light wavelengths and four different food conditions. Both the free-swimming and tethered Gaussia showed no significant preference for any food type, light wavelength, or combination of food and light. Two possible foraging strategies of the Gaussia are suggested. Comparison of the observed foraging strategies of the Gaussia to the known foraging tactics of the shallow-water calanoid copepods of similar structure show that Gaussia may be a suspension feeding herbivore or a cruise and sink feeding omnivore. This conclusion was made on the basis that the time copepods spend beating their mouthparts is a measure of foraging strategy.","584":"Encased within a bacteria associated sheath, the embryos of the squid Loligo opalescens are able to withstand a three to five week incubation period on the ocean floor. It appears that the unidentified bacteria are symbionts of the developing embryos; the longer the association with the sheath, the further the development of the embryos. When the sheath remained, but the bacteria was removed with antibiotics, the stripped fingers showed a greater susceptibility when exposed to fungal-rich solutions. The experimental evidence suggests that the sheath bacteria are symbionts of the developing Loligo opalescens embryos.","585":"Different types of Na channels may be distinguished not only between species but also within individual organisms. Investigation in to the differences between Na channel isoforms may be useful in elucidating mechanisms by which Na channels carry out their specific functional roles within cells. In this study, two RNA probes transcribed from segments of cDNA encoding a putative squid giant axon Na channel GFLN1 were employed in insitu hybridizations and RNase protection assays to detect Na channel messenger RNAs in the stellate ganglion, optic lobe and mantle muscle of the squid Loligo opalescens. The results of this study indicate the presence of additional Na channel mRNAs with partial sequence homology to GFLN1 mRNA in squid stellate gangiona and optic lobe, and provide evidence for the expression of Na channel mRNA in mantle muscle cells of L. opalescens.","586":"The sulfide binding characteristics of blood serum were studied in-vitro in two deep-sea vesicomyid clams, Calyptogena pacifica and Vesicomya gigas. Both the C. pacifica and the V. gigas serum concentrated sulfide at least an order of magnitude above ambient levels. V. gigas accumulated sulfide faster than C. pacifica, reaching saturation at 5000 M after an hour. C. pacifica bound sulfide at half the rate of V. gigas, reaching saturation in about two hours at a substantially higher concentration of sulfide. The observed distribution of the animals near cold seeps in the Monterey Submarine Canyon can be explained by their different sulfide binding abilities. The hypothesis that cold seeps are actually much more unstable sources of sulfide than previously assumed is explored.","587":"Muscle cells from the mantle of the squid Loligo opalescens were dissociated and allowed to settle on plates located with collagen. They were bathed in either high calcium medium (HCM, 10.8 mM Ca+2) or low calcium medium (LCM, 1.3 mM ca+2) and stimulated with a series of electrical shocks. The initial medium was then replaced by one with a differing calcium concentration, and the same series of shock was again administered. Cells exhibited a variety of responses to shock, but the most typical was a rapid contraction that grew stronger with increasing voltage. Switching the cells from LCM to HCM slightly increased contraction strength and slightly lowered the minimum voltage necessary to produce a twitch. Switching from high calcium to low had no discernable effect on contraction strength or threshold voltage. Likewise, the addition of tetrodotoxin until it reached a concentration of 200 nM also had no effect, regardless of the external calcium concentration. External calcium concentration in the culture medium strongly affected the cell mortality rate. Almost all cells (>90%) kept in HCM for 20 hrs were completely unresponsive to electrical stimulation. By contrast, about 50% of cells kept in the LCM continued to respond to stimulation even after a period of several days.","588":"The predatory gastropod, Kelletia kelletii, was studied in the lab and in the field to characterize its habitat characteristics, distribution patterns, activity patterns, and escape responses. The mean density of Kelletia was 0.32 \/m2, and their depth range was 5.5 to 1.2 m. Snail sizes differed significantly between those found on rock and on sand: the mean size of snails found on rock was 78.4 mm, while the mean size for snails found on sand was 92.9 mm. Adult snails in the lab and field bury themselves for up to 152 hours, punctuated with bursts of activity. There was no significant relationship between the percent time buried, the length of the buried period, the length of the active period, or the rate of movement, and size of snails. No clear relationship existed between the activity pattern and foraging, and gut content analysis was inconclusive. Kelletia captured and consumed Tegula or Calliostoma ligatum in both the lab and field. A large mating aggregation was found during the study. Snails were significantly larger within this aggregation. Kelletia exhibited no escape response to three sea stars and a crab.","589":"The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there is a relationship between lowered nitrate levels in seawater and subsequent degradation of phycobilins in Rhodymenia pacifica when grown under adequate light. Phycobilins, accessory photosynthetic pigments, are often degraded under nitrate stress because of their high nitrogen content. In this experiment, the subtidal red alga R. pacifica was placed in tanks of artificial seawater with varying nitrate concentrations (0, 10, and 20 uM) and the phycobilin levels of these thalli were traced over five weeks. Phycobilin levels in the thalli in all treatments decreased significantly among weeks and treatments. Thalli given no nitrate had lower phycobilin levels than the 10 and 20 uM treatments, whose levels decreased at approximately the same rate. Additional thalli were grown in natural seawater with identical experimental conditions; their phycobilin levels decreased less markedly over time. All thalli except for those in natural seawater began to turn green at their tips after approximately two weeks; this green tissue was very weak and degraded when it was touched. Chlorophyll a levels of all samples remained constant throughout the experiment, and there was no growth of any thalli. Elemental analysis of the tissues was performed; there was a significant increase in percent carbon in all treatments over time, but no significant changes in percent nitrogen. In conclusion, there is a definite trend which shows that decreased nitrate concentrations do lower phycobilin concentrations over time. However, there presence of green thalli tissue suggests that there may have been other factors involved as well.","590":"The activity of the pentose phosphate shunt increases soon after fertilization of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs, and this increase is correlated with a change in the intracellular distribution of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose shunt. This enzyme is found in a bound, inactive state in unfertilized eggs and in a soluble, active state in newly fertilized zygotes. The signaling pathway that links fertilization to the release of G6PD from the bound state is not known. In this study, I have investigated whether tyrosine kinase activity is involved in fertilization-induced G6PD release in sea urchin eggs.","591":"Fractals describe the increase in length of a line with a decrease in the scale at which it is measured. A greater fractal dimension at a particular scale may translate into more habitat space for an animal of that size, and therefore greater expected abundances of that animal. I tested for the presence of such a relationship between the alga Mastocarpus papillatus and the small snails, Littorina scutulata and Tricolia pulloides, living on it. The use of M. papillatus provided a range of morphologies so that the effects of fractal dimension could be examined within a species of alga. This intra-species comparison allowed for a control of the grazing quality of the alga. Indeed higher fractal dimension was shown to correlate with a higher density of snails.","592":"Renibacterium salmoninarum is an intracellular pathogen that survives within the macrophages of salmonids. The ability of R. salmoninarum to produces p57, a major surface antigen of the bacterium, while inside rainbow trout macrophages was determined. R. salmoninarum was incubated with rainbow trout macrophages isolated from the head kidney and spleen, and phagocytosis occurred as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. Macrophages were then lysed and a Western blot was run on the lysate, to determine the presence of p57. Macrophages incubated with only L-15 media showed no p57 production nor did macrophages incubated with killed R. salmoninarum. Macrophages incubated with R. salmoninarum showed the presence of p57, thus indicating that p57 was produced by R. salmoninarum while inside the trout macrophages. These results suggest that p57 may play a role in the intracellular survival of R. salmoninarum.","593":"Littorina planaxis, an intertidal snail, is abundant on a variety of substrata. Two rocks, granite and basalt, were examined to determine if the rock type or the roughness of the rock influenced the movement pattern or population density of the snail. A diffusion model was used to quantify the spread of the snail across the rock in rough, intermediate and smooth areas on each rock type. Additionally, the fractal dimension of the rock was measured on each site in an attempt to quantify the topography of the rock and to provide a less subjective estimate of roughness or smoothness.","594":"The activity of yellowfin tuna Tunnus albacares in captivity was assayed through observations of speed, distance travelled in a day, and tailbeat. Cytochrome oxidase and myosin ATPase assays were conducted on red and white muscle tissues from wild and captive yellowfin tuna to determine a relative level of these enzyme activities. The speeds calculated for the captive tuna were found to be significantly less than speeds found by tracking wild tuna, indicating that captivity may be reducing tuna activity. In addition, the enzyme assays revealed that cytochrome oxidase activity in captive white muscle tissue appears to be distinctly different than that in wild white muscle tissue, and different isoforms of myosin ATPase may be expressed in captive red and white muscle tissues than those in wild red and white muscle tissues.","595":"The spatial scales of variation of three intertidal invertebrates were determined using a nested sampling design and optimal quadrat size for each species. Sampling was done at sites, which were kilometers apart; subsites within sites, which were roughly 100 meters apart; transects within subsites, which were about 10 meters apart; and quadrats, which were on the scale of meters apart. An analysis of variance revealed that Lottia limatula is patchy on the spatial scale of tens of meters, while Serpulorbis squamigerus is patchy on the spatial scale of hundreds of meters, with considerable spatial variation within the patches themselves. For Littorina planaxis, there were no significant differences at any of three levels of nesting, indicating that the snail is fairly evenly distributed in the sites sampled. The index of departure from the Poisson distribution and the index of aggregation for S. squamigerus and L. planaxis indicate that both species tend to have clumped distributions, which agree with the natural histories of these organisms. The indices are more ambiguous for L. limatula, but the presence of a few high and many low count, as well as aspects from the natural history of this organism, indicate a clumped distribution. Determination of the spatial scales of variation for an organism to be studied permits the formation of a sampling design that maximizes accuracy and precision while minimizing the total costs in terms of time, effort, and money.","596":"Microtubules are a cytoskeletal, filamentous polymer that have been shown to play a role in fast axonal transport in nerve cells. Further it has been hypothesized that microtubule stability is a factor in determining cell excitability. By culturing Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells that express the KZ4, shaker potassium channel protein in demecolcine, a microtubule destabilizing drug, it has been shown that there is a link between microtubule stability and the proper expression of the channel through the use of electrophysiology, immuno-flourescence, and immuno-precipitation techniques.","597":"Anthopleura elegantissima, Heat shock protein, bleaching, thermal stress, heat shock, Hsp 70, hsp70","598":"Previous studies have shown that the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in liver of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus increases approximately two-fold after two weeks of hypoxia. However, nothing is known about the early response of LDH activity to hypoxia. In this study the effects of shorter durations of hypoxia on LDH activities in Fundulus heteroclitus were examined. Hypoxia was induced in aquaria by gassing with an air\/nitrogen mixture. After 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of hypoxia fish were killed and livers prepared for LDH assays. LDH activity in liver of Fundulus heteroclitus increased two-fold after two days of hypoxia. This finding demonstrates that the response to hypoxia in Fundulus heteroclitus is much faster than previous research has suggested. These results in F. heteroclitus are consistent with previous findings that mRNA encoding LDH increases after 16 hours of hypoxia in human cell cultures. Possible molecular mechanisms underlying the hypoxia-induced increase in LDH activity are discussed.","599":"Through the months of December 1994 - March 1995 captive yellowfin tuna kept at the Tuna Research and Conservation Center in Monterey, CA displayed behavioral and physiological signs of high whole body lipid levels. Autopsies revealed lipid accumulation in the heart, gills, and muscles and 4 sudden deaths occurred that may have been due to cardiac arrest or lipid accumulation in the blood. The fish acted sluggish and over-satiated during feedings. Possible high lipid levels in the diet were thought to be a contributing factor to increased lipid storage in the tissue. To test this hypothesis, diet was cut for the months of April and May from 2 times a day every day to once a day every other day. Individual tuna in each tank were followed during the feedings and data were recorded on type of food eaten, amount of food eaten and activity level before and during feeding. Food amounts obtained from these observations were analyzed for fat content and total caloric content. Old and new diets were compared on this basis. In addition histological techniques were used to compare fat levels in red and white muscle tissue of TRCC tuna-fed a diet of squid, anchovies and sardines, with Kewalo basin captive tuna -fed a diet of 100% squid.","600":"The cnidarian Anthopleura elegantissima is subject to a wide variety of external stresses. The effects of decreased salinity were examined in the field and in a laboratory environment. Animals were experimentally subjected to decreased salinities of 10 ppt, 17ppt, and 25 ppt over a period of 4 days. Laboratory results suggest that salinity stress induces algal cell loss, however, cell loss was not observed in the field. Mechanisms of release active in bleaching under salinity stress appear to result in the release of free algae.","601":"A highly conserved portion of the RyR channel region was amplified, cloned and cycle sequenced from Brachiostoma lanceolatum (amphioxus) and Mustelus californicus (smoothhound dogfish). Two isoforms, Ryr1 and RyR3, are expressed in most vertebrate skeletal muscle, while RyR1 is the sole isoform expressed in mammalian and some reptilian skeletal muscle. The purposed of the study were 1) to investigate how primitive the two isoform condition is, and 2) to determine what clues the sequences of primitive vertebrate RyRs provide about structure and or function in the channel region. In comparisons with published RyR sequences, amphioxus and shark displayed an overall high level of sequence identity with all isoforms in this region. Molecular phylogenetic analyses clustered the amphioxus and shark sequences with the published RyR1 sequences. One region of 50 contiguous amino acids located within a possible transmembrane region did display high variability among species. However, hydrophilicity profiles of amphioxus, shark, fish RyR1, and frog alpha sequences in this region revealed similar patterns of hydrophobicity. This common characteristic indicates that the amino acid differences mostly likely do not impact on structure or function in this region.","602":"The ability of cephalopods to hear has been controversial for some time (Moynihan 1985; Budelmann and Hanlon 1987). However, the organs specialized to detect tiny water vibrations characteristic of sound have been identified (Budelmann 1992), and experiments have been successful in showing that cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, have the ability to associate low frequency sounds (below 100 Hz) with negative stimuli such as electric shock (Packard et al. 1990). In the following experiments, it was determined that cuttlefish can hear within a frequency range of 9 Hz to 9260 Hz, and that cuttlefish possess the ability to complete a task, combining the cognitive ability to associate a sound stimuli with the presentation of food.","603":"The two intertidal species of Tegula, T. funebralis and T. brunnea show distinct vertical zonation patterns. T. funebralis is found throughout the mid intertidal zone and into the low zone, while T. brunnea is found in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. Experiments were conducted to test whether desiccation, predation, or microhabitat preferences were affecting the distributions of the two species. Results indicate that the inability to tolerate prolonged exposure to heat and desiccation keeps T. brunnea low in the intertidal zone. The predators Pisaster ochraceous and Cancer antenarius, which live low intertidally, were not shown to preferentially eat T. funebralis in the lab or the field. Predation pressures on both species were shown to be low at Hopkins Marine Station, suggesting that predation was not a major force maintaining the lower limit of T. funebralis. Microhabitat preferences of the two species differ, indicating that microhabitat choice may play a role in maintaining zonation patterns. The role of other factors such as competition, behavior, and larval settlement are discussed.","604":"The utility of fractal geometry as a descriptive tool in the natural sciences has increased as more and more naturally occurring fractal patterns have emerged. Fractals have been used to describe the shape of plants, the length of coastlines and the porous nature of rocks. This study focuses on determining if the three rock types--granite, basalt, and sandstone--in the Monterey Bay region have a fractal nature and if so, how that nature may affect the standing biomass. Basalt was found to have a higher fractal dimension than either granite or sandstone on the scale of 10 cm. On the scale of 1 m, both granite and sandstone have a higher fractal dimension than that measured on the 10 cm scale. In the protected site, plant biomass on granite was significantly greater than that on the sandstone. There as no correlation between the fractal dimension of substratum and the animal, plant or total biomass. Fractal dimension did not, in this case, prove to be a useful technique for describing substrata in the rocky intertidal zone.","605":"Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated channels serve as the downstream target in vertebrate visual transduction. However, it is not known whether cGMP-gated channels play a similar role in photoreceptors from invertebrates. Inside-out patch clamping of solitary photoreceptor cells isolated from the retina of the squid(Loligo opalescens) revealed that the probability of channel opening increases from a baseline of Po=0.20 in the absence of cGMP to near saturation (Po=0.91) at 100 uM cGMP, suggesting the existence of cGMP-gated channels. The probability of channel openings was independent of membrane potential over the range -60 to +60 mV. Data from these macroscopic patches revealed multiple channel types with unitary conductances ranging from 10 to 125 pS in symmetrical Na+ solutions. Conductance of a 100 pS channel was blocked by the addition of 2 mM Ca2+ to the inner face of the patch. However, channel activity persists in the presence of 60 mM Mg2+, a divalent cation concentration sufficient to block cGMP-gated channels in vertebrate photoreceptors. This suggests a significant difference in vertebrate and invertebrate cGMP-gated channel structure. The results of this study indicate that cGMP-gated channels are the effectors in invertebrate phototransduction.","606":"Cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) both act as secondary messengers in odor transduction, activating ion channels in Pagurus samuelis olfactory receptor neurons. Two different cGMP-gated ion channels were observed in inside-out patches in symmetrical Na+ solutions: one with a conductance of 22 pS, and the other with a more varied conductance of approximately 86 pS. Unlike cGMP-gated channels in vertebrate olfactory receptors which are blocked by divalent cations, these cGMP channels were not blocked by 60 mM Mg++. They were however completely blocked by the addition of Ca++ to the inner face of the patch. An IPa3-gated ion channel with a conductance of 13 pS was observed that wad also not blocked by Mg++. There was also suggestion of two additional IP3 channels with larger conductances. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of cGMP- and IP3-gated ion channels in Pagurus olfactory receptor neurons. This dual signal transduction pathway, mediated by cGMP and IP3, may allow for the integration of a broader range of information representing a blend of odors.","607":"The squid Loligo opalescens deposit their egg cases in conspicuous masses on the floor of Monterey Bay. These egg masses remain largely undisturbed by predation during the 30 days until embryo hatching. A reproductive gland of the adult female squid contains bacteria of predominantly one species which the female includes in the egg case during spawning. These bacteria are of the genus Shewenella, closely related to Shewenella putrefaciens, a putrefying marine bacteria which is characterized by the production of extremely large quantities of the polyamine putrescine. In this study, bacteria isolated from the squid gland and egg sheath were examined by HPLC to determine the quantity of putrescine. The bacteria contained amounts of putrescine comparable to S. putrefaciens. The possible role of the putrescine was then examined in a chemotactic response assay utilizing the starfish Pisaster ochraceus, a common predator at the depth of the egg masses. S. putrefaciens, the squid bacteria and a solution of putrescine were found to be significant deterrents to the P. ochraceus while a control strain, Vibrio harveyi, with low levels of putrescine showed no deterrence. These results suggest a role for putrescine in the protection of the L. opalescens egg cases from predation.","608":"The metabolic potentials of two Monterey submarine canyon cold seep clam species, Calyptogena kilmeri and C. pacifica, were compared using two enzymes involved in ATP generation: citrate synthase (CS), used in aerobiosis, and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), primarily used in anaerobiosis. Although both species live in high sulfide environments, C. Kilmeri experiences a significantly higher sulfide concentration than C. pacifica (>6 mM sulfide vs. 0.1 mM sulfide). MDH and CS assays were conducted on foot, gill, mantle, and adductor tissues from both species. Calyptogena kilmeri was found to have lower CS activity and higher MDH activity than C. pacifica. The lower CS activity in C. kilmeri suggests that the near anoxic environment caused by high sulfide concentrations suppresses aerobic metabolism, favoring a high anaerobic metabolic potential in this species.","609":"This study, conducted at the Hopkins Marine Refuge in Pacific Grove, CA examined haul-out effects of the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) on the rocky intertidal community. The study employed a nested sampling design, consisting of three replicate plots each within three haul-out intensity sites, low, medium and high. Plots were sampled using 20 X 30 cm quadrates haphazardly placed within a vertical range of 1.5 to 3 feet above MLLW. Due to the high level of heterogeneity in the rocky midtidal, only large differences among haul-out sites could be detected by our experimental design. A lack of significant differences among haul-out sites does not rule out the possibility of actual impact by harbor seals. Observed trends indicate that haul-out of harbor seals may have a moderate impact on the rocky midtidal community.","610":"Abundance and distribution data were collected on three species of turban snails (Tegula) in a temperate kelp forest, the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge. Similar data at identical sties in the same forest were collected by Watanabe (1984). Tegula abundances from the present study and Watanabe (1984) were compared. Overall Tegula density has increased significantly since the earlier study. A bathymetric zonation of Tegula that was documented in the earlier study was borne out in my study. Tegula brunnea occurs in shallow water (0-6m) , T. pulligo occurs mostly in deep water (7-12m), and T. montereyi is the least abundant everywhere, but present everywhere. T. montereyi has been anecdotally observed to have increased in density in the past 15 years, and this trend appears in my data, but is not statistically significant.","611":"Tunas increase their core body temperature through endothermy, creating a gradient of increasing temperature from the skin to the core. I examined biochemical adaptations such as isozyme expression and temperature compensation of enzyme activity in muscle at different positions along the 4.8 C gradient in kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis). Studies in fishes have demonstrated that temperature changes cause differential expression of the two isozymes - thermostable and thermolabile - of malate dehydrogenase (MDH). These observations prompted me to determine MDH thermostability (ratio of thermostable to thermolabile isozymes) in tuna muscles along the temperature gradient. Contrary to expectation, MDH thermostability in red muscle appeared to decrease and in white muscle remained constant along the gradient from skin to core. MDH thermostability was consistently higher in white muscle than red muscle, possibly due to differential metabolic requirements of red and white muscle. Furthermore, citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and MDH activities were measured to determine whether they changed according to the thermal gradient. Neither red nor white muscle showed a change in enzyme activities according to the temperature difference from skin to core.","612":"The wave-exposed, rocky outcrops of the intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station (Pacific Grove, CA) exhibit large numbers of Lottia gigantea grazing and homing on what appears to be shared territories. This contradicts previous studies in which Lottia were found to be solitary and territorial, aggressively repelling intruders and forming distinct territories of bare rock. This study observed 58 individually tagged limpets on four sites located on two vertical rock faces. By taking multiple observations of limpet displacements, recorded on predrawn maps of each site, limpet home scars and territory boundaries were identified. Limpet size and home scar height above mean lower water were also measured. Nineteen individuals were identified as non-territorial, 32 as territorial, and 7 an indistinguishable (no movement was recorded). Non-territorial limpets grazed an area larger than those of their territorial counterparts (mean=351 cm2 vs. 1299 cm2). The variation suggests that Lottia territorial behavior may be more complex than previously thought.","613":"Two intertidal species of Tegula T. brunnea and T. funebralis, display distinct vertical zonation. T. brunnea inhabit the lower intertidal to shallow subtidal zone, while T. funebralis are found in the upper-mid intertidal zone. Reciprocal transplants of each species to the habitat of the other revealed that T. brunnea returns to its typical height on the shore significantly more quickly than does T. funebralis. Transplanted T. brunnea and transplanted T. funebralis move significantly further and in a more consistent direction than do control animals placed back in their respective natural habitats. Although no statistical differences were observed between transplants done in high and low tides, a consistent trend of less movement by T. brunnea during low tides was observed. Microhabitat utilization during simulated low and high tides in the laboratory showed that T. brunnea remains submerged an on horizontal surfaces significantly more than T. funebralis, which tend to occupy vertical surfaces both above and below the waterline. Night and daytime behavior are similar for T. funebralis and differ for T. brunnea in the laboratory.","614":"Wave exposure is a complex set of biotic and abiotic factors, including variations in physical force, light, temperature, and nutrient levels. This study examines the distribution and morphology of an intertidal rockweed, Pelvetia compressa (Fucales, Phaeophyta) at three sites along a wave exposure gradient on the Monterey Peninsula, California, US.A. Percent cover and vertical ranges were similar between the most exposed and intermediately exposed sites and much greater than at the most protected site. A discriminant function analysis of morphological data shows that the three populations may be objectively classified into three groups based on morphology. After a discriminant function analysis, it is possible to accurately predict the site of origination for most of the thalli examined. Patterns between the morphological data from the extremes of wave exposure suggest that plants at the most exposed location tend to break at lower internodes, producing a \"leggy\" and pruned morphology compared to those at the protected site. This pruning may serve to lower drag forces and hence be an adaptation to heavy wave exposure. It is unclear from the data what factors are responsible for patterns seen at the intermediate exposure site; differences in age structure or other demographic factors may plan an important role.","615":"This study examined the diet of the generalized predatory sea star Pisaster giganteus, comparing proportions of various species in the diet to abundance in the habitat. Comparisons to assess temporal variation were made to similar data collected in the same site in 1981 (Harrold 1981). Relative frequencies of prey species in the diet and in the habitat were tabulated. The past and present diets of sea stars overlap considerably, with a Morista overlap index of 0.667 and nearly identical Shannon-weiner diversity indices (2.035 in 1981 compared to 2.029 now). However, a Chi-square analysis reveals several major differences: (1) the absence of the vermetid gastropod Petaloconchus montereyensis, and (2) an increase in the frequency of two other sessile prey species, the barnacle Balanus spp. and another vermetid, Serpulorbis squamigerus. The absence of Petaloconchus in the diet was due to its low abundance in the habitat. The increased feeding on Balanus and Serpulorbis cannot be explained by changes in abundance, which were not statistically significant. Rather, I hypothesize that the absence of Petaloconchus, previously a reliable, easily obtainable source of energy, led to increased feeding on these other sessile prey species. Further study is needed to explore the impact of other factors, such as individual sea star variation.","616":"Animals from different latitudes and intertidal heights show differences in thermal stability of the enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) suggesting that protein thermal stability may be important in establishing species distributions (Dahlhoff and Somero, 1993). I examined whether algae from different tidal zones exhibit similar variation in protein thermostability. Algae that are exposed to air and direct sunlight during the tidal cycle can experience temperatures of up to 37 C. The two algal species studied were the low intertidal species Ulva expansa and the high intertidal Enteromorpha spp., which are submerged only under the highest tides. Individuals from Ulva and Enteromorpha (Division Chlorophyta, Order Ulotrichiales, Family Ulvacea) were collected from the Monterey Harbor and from the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge beach in central California, respectively. Heat denaturations of MDH were performed at 45 C on algal homogenates of each species. In all four trials, the residual activity of Enteromorpha MDH was greater than that of Ulva MDH. These differences were statistically significant at 20 and 40 min (unpaired t-test, P=0.0026 and 0.0228, respectively), though the difference between overall rates of activity loss was not statistically significant. Further experimental approaches to studying thermostability enzymes in algae are proposed.","617":"Tityustoxin-Ka (TsTX-Ka) is a 37 amino acid peptide component of the venom of the scorpion, Tityus serrulatus, and blocks voltage-gated K+ current (Ik) in highly specific channel types. TsTX-Ka is structurally similar to charybdotoxin, agitoxin-2, and other scorpion toxins that bind to the extracellular surface of the pore-forming region of Kv1-type (Shaker) channels. The action of TsTX-Ka was studied on squid K+ channels using the whole-cell patch clamp technique with dissociated giant fiber lobe (GFL) neurons and with inscet Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus carrying the cDNA for the corresponding channel (Brock et al., 1996). Under standard conditions (12 C, pH 7.6, 20 mM external K+), TsTX-Ka reduces Ik for a strong voltage step (+40 mV) in GFL neurons with an estimated Kd of 50 nM. Steady state voltage dependence and activation kinetics of residual Ik are minimally affected in 300 nM TsTX-Ka, but inactivation kinetics are accelerated. Similar results were obtained in SF9 cells. Block of Ik in GFL neurons by TsTX-ka (300 nM) depends on external pH. Less block occurs at low pH, with half-block occurring at pH 6.0, approximately the pKa of histidine (6.02). This amino acid is located in the SqKv1A channel (H351) at a position homologous to F425 in Shaker B, a residue critical to binding of charybdotoxin (Goldstein, et al., 1994) and agitoxin-2 (Gross & MacKinnon, 1996). These results suggest that H351 in the external mouth of the squid SqKv1A channel is also a determinant of TsTX-ka binding, and that protonation of the side chain of this residue may decrease toxin sensitivity by electrostatic repulsion.","618":"Foraging on intertidal mussels by the California sea otter, Enhydra lutris, was examined to determine its effects on the mussel beds around Point Cabrillo, Pacific Grove, CA. Frequency of success for foraging on mussels and foraging on other types of prey were observed, as well as the mean number of mussels removed and eaten by otters. The average duration of individual feeding bouts and the average number of dives per minute were measured in order to discover the mean number of mussels removed a day. These data were analyzed comparing individual otter eating habits. Frequency of success for mussel (94.53%) and non-mussel foraging (69.05%) and were significantly different (p<<0.001). There was also significant inter-individual variance in mean number of mussels removed (p<<0.001) and mean number of mussels eaten (p<<0.001) among different otters. Foraging on mussels in relation to increasing wave heights showed a significant decrease in number of mussels removed (p<0.005) and mussels eaten (p<0.001) as wave height increased. Success ratio also decreased as wave height increased (p<0.01). In addition, the frequency of foraging on mussel beds increased with tidal height and was more prevalent in the early evening compared to the other times of the day.","619":"The neogastropod mollusk Olivella biplicata possesses an extension of the mantle fold referred to as the mantle flap. Its function is undetermined. The structure extends from mantle tissue dorsal to the siphon and lays flat against the exposed top surface of the animal's shell, rarely covering more than approximately 20% of the shell surface. It may extend as far back as the apical whorl of the shell and can be fully retracted. Excised flaps begin regeneration within one week. The structure plays no part in the light sensing ability of the nocturnal snail, but may affect its ability to sense water-borne chemicals. Olivella with their mantle flaps artificially removed locate crushed Mytilus roughly one hour slower than unmanipulated counterparts (P<0.0l). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy reveal dense, motile cilia lining the lateral edges of the flab. SEM of the surface of the structure in direct contact with shell makes visible possible sensory cilia. No evidence was found for the potential role of the flap in shell cleaning. A program for future study directed at elucidating the function of the mantle flap is suggested.","620":"Mussels of the species, Mytilus californianus, are known to have a multidrug-resistance transport protein (p-glycoprotein, MDR) analogous to the multidrug resistance protein found in many human tumor cell lines, which protectively transports a wide range of moderately hydrophobic and potentially toxic compounds out of cells. Previous studies have suggested the transporter may be inducible by exposure to environmental toxins. The present study examined whether exposure to toxic compounds would induce mussels to increase synthesis or activity of p-glycoprotein. After exposing animals for 1-3 weeks to two model genotoxic compounds, 2-Acetylaminofluorene and 3-Methylcholanthrene, gill tissues were analyzed by Western Blot to quantify protein levels. In addition, two assays analyzing the efflux rates of a fluorescent p-glycoprotein substrate were employed in order to study the kinetics of the transporter's activity. Results of the kinetics assays showed no significant difference between control organisms and exposed organisms in rates of efflux of the fluorescent substrate (ANCOVA: p=0.924, p=0.357). Western analyses to date have been inconclusive. Thus, this study does not show significant inductive effects of exposures to non-lethal levels of genotoxin.","621":"The red alga, Endocladia muricata, and the barnacle, Balanus glandula, form a widespread association in the rocky intertidal along the Pacific coast of North American (Glynn 1965). One portion of that zone, at Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, was examined to determine its vertical height and species composition. These measurements were then compared with data from Glynn (1965). The current upper and lower limits of E. muricata are an average of 1.20 and 1.05 feet lower respectively than they were in 1965. At three of Glynn's study sites, replicate 5x5 cm quadrats were sampled in the middle of the current Endocladia zone, taking care to duplicate as many of Glynn's original quadrate characteristics as possible. Analysis of algal biomass showed no significant change in the abundance of E. muricata in these areas. The species composition of the assemblage has changed little, but there has been a significant change in the relative abundances of species. Abundance of the bivalve, Musculus sp., has increased significantly, while that of the barnacle, B. glandula, has decreased. These finding indicate that much of the E. muricata animal community has moved downward along with the algal cover, but that the abundance of a few predominate species within this community has changed. These data provide a base for future quantitative studies of temporal change in the E. muricata zone and may aid in evaluating the effects of environmental change on intertidal habitats.","622":"The effects of wave action on the dynamics of intertidal communities are often modeled viewing seawater as a pure fluid. This assumption overlooks the potential consequences of solid ocean debris, including rocks, animal shells, and other hard objects, which can be \"thrown\" into the intertidal zone at high velocities. Wave projectile action at directly wave-exposed areas can play a substantial role in the survivorship of L. gigantea. Limpets living on rock faces at directly-exposed sites experienced substantial levels of wave projectile damage on days with high wave action. Limpets living on rock faces that experienced deflected waves or waves that \"ramped\" off lower rock beds were significantly less affected by wave-projectiles. This suggests that the effects of wave action on limpet survivorship can depend on the local topography as well as the disturbance caused directly by hydrodynamic forces.","623":"Gillichthys mirabilis, the longjaw mudsucker, is a Gobiid fish that lives under a wide variety of temperature ranges in bays and estuaries along the Pacific coast of North America. A population genetics study could suggest whether genetic differences associated with differential physiological adaptations have occurred. Samples of Gillichthys mirabilis from three locations: Hayward, CA, San Diego, CA, and San Felipe, Mexico, were analyzed using isozyme electrophoresis and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), a recently developed DNA fingerprinting technique. Three questions were posed: 1) Are the populations of Gillichthys mirabilis separate or interbreeding? 2) If the populations are interbreeding, to what extent does interbreeding occur?, and 3) Is AFLP a sensitive and reliable technique to use for a population genetics study of this species?","624":"The Pacific salmon shark, Lamna ditropis (Hubbs & Follett, 1947), can maintain core body temperatures 7-11 degrees C above ambient waters--the highest body-temperature elevation of any shark measured to date. Gross anatomical studies of three subjects revealed that the mechanism for such endothermy is facilitated by counter-current heat exchangers common in other lamnids and scombrids. In these fish, retia mirabilia--\"wonderful nets\" of interwoven vessels and\/or sinuses-act as metabolic heat recyclers. L. ditropis possesses four retial systems, three of which serve the viscera and muscle, much like the retia of its Atlantic cousin, the porbeagle shark, Lamna nasus. The lateral cutaneous rete begins laterally in the white muscle and serves the well-insulated internal red muscle. This tubular rete, composed of bundles of arteries and veins, is small in area near the skin, but divides and widens as it nears the internal red muscle. The viscera is warmed by the supra-hepatic rete, a two-lobed tissue lying posterier to the heart and dorsal to the liver lobes. Minute arteries repeatedly converge and coalesce in this rete in a honeycomb pattern, and the entire arterial mass is contained in a large venous sinus. The sub-renal rete consists of a small anterior retial lobe plus its lateral extension, which runs the length of the kidney, conserving metabolic heat created there. We propose that the combined efficiency of these retial systems allows L. ditropis to occupy its icy niche, the most polar of any shark.","625":"Blood samples are used in many organisms as an indication of health and physiological state. In yellowfin tuna, blood analysis is complicated by stress responses to handling. These responses include changes in serum osmolarity, blood metabolites, and release of red blood cells from the spleen leading to increased hematocrit. Samples from stressed fish therefore do not accurately represent the resting health and physiology of an individual. This study presents a new method developed to minimize stress levels during blood sampling. Blood is drawn from the bulbus arteriosis of captive yellowfin tuna while the fish are still in the tank. Twenty-seven samples were taken from 18 individuals over the course of seven weeks. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell counts, ions, and metabolites were measured and compared to values obtained from fish sampled using other common techniques. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values were similar to those measured in chronically cannulated tuna, and lower than for fish sampled using a common practice of capture in a net (hematocrit 31.6%\u00b10.8 vs.44.1%\u00b18.5; hemoglobin 11.1 g\/d1\u00b10.3 vs. 17.0 g\/d1\u00b12.0). Creatine phosphokinase, potassium, and creatinine (all related to stress and\/or increased muscle activity) significantly increased in net-sampled fish. Therefore, fish sampled using a bulbus puncture appear to be less stressed. Using this sampling technique, an experiment was run in which diet in one tank was changed from a normal 1% fat diet to a high 8% fat diet. Blood samples were taken before and after the 8% diet treatment. Serum free fatty acid concentrations doubled (0.25 mmol\/L\u00b10.03 vs. 0.524 mmol\/L \u00b10.03) in the 8% fat fed fish that were sampled. The results of the experiments demonstrate an ability to measure changes in blood chemistry using the new sampling techniques. This study will help determine what is physiologically \"normal\" in yellowfin tuna blood.","626":"In Monterey Bay, Porcelain crabs inhabit discrete vertical zones: Petrolithes cinctipes is found intertidally and P. manimaculis is found subtidally. Differences in maximal temperature and emersion time for each species are associated with their individual vertical zonation. The thermal stability of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a homogenate supernatant from P. cinctipes is greater than that from P. manimaculis. Purification of LDH removes this difference, causing the thermal stability of purified LDH from P. cinctipes to decrease to that of P. manimaculis. Thus some extrinsic factor may influence the proteins' thermal stability. To determine whether the enzyme thermal stability could be altered, I acclimated crabs to various conditions of temperature and emersion. Temperature rose between 8-15 degrees C above ambient seawater temperature during the 5.5 hour emersion time in one treatment, but did not change in the constantly immersed treatment. High levels of mortality were only observed for P. manimaculis in the emersion treatment. Thermal stabilities of LDH in homogenate supernatants did not change over a 36 day acclimation period. Differences in LDH thermal stability between species persisted. These data suggest that the mechanism causing the difference in stability between supernatant and purified enzyme is a highly regulated and conserved trait which was not affected by conditions of the experiment.","627":"The market squid Loligo opalescens is distributed along the West coast of North America from Southern Alaska to Baja California. Management of this growing fishery has been difficult due to the lack of knowledge of the population structure of this species. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) was thus employed in order to detect the existence of distinct populations along the West coast. The technique (developed by Vos et al., 1995) includes three general steps: digestion of genomic DNA with two restriction enzymes and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, preamplification of a subset of the restriction fragments, and an additional selective amplification using 33P labeled primers in order to visualize the restriction fragments on an autoradiogram. Preliminary results show the consistency and sensitivity of this technique, as well as an indication of genetic variation among L. opalescens from different locations. However, larger sample sizes would need to be analyzed before any conclusive evidence of population structure can be shown.","628":"In October of 1991, a National Marine Fishery Survey conducted at the 200 m depth contour along a segment of sand-mud canyon bottom between Ascension Canyon and Monterey Canyon in the Monterey Bay revealed an unusually large population of Octopus rubescens (852 octopuses ha-1, SE=179.8). When re-sampled in March of 1997 using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV),the O. rubescens population was found to have significantly decreases in size (3 octopuses ha-1, SE=3.2, p<0.001). Fishery effects on predatory rockfish and factors affecting juvenile recruitment were found to be the most plausible causes for the large 1991 O.rubescens populations. The effect of these factors could not be established for the smaller 1997 populations because of insufficient data. Large increases in numbers of harbor seals, Phoca vitulina, within the bay may be contribution significantly to the O. rubescens decline.","629":"At the Tuna Research and Conservation Center, in Monterey, California, captive yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) demonstrated an increase in lipid accumulation and mortalities when fed a high calorie and high fat diet. To determine what influence a high fat diet has on tuna physiology, one tank (T2) holding 28 fish was designated for diet manipulation while oxygen consumption and stomach temperatures were used to measure changes in metabolism. No significant differences in metabolic rate were measured between diet treatments. The low fat diet (LFD; 1% fat content in kcal) was composed of squid and smelt while the high fat diet (HFD;8% fat content in kcal) only included sardines. Samples were sent away for bomb colorimetry analysis and based on these values, an equivalent total caloric level (28 kcal\/kg\/day) was maintained between diets. Individual respirometry trials were performed in a Closed-system respirometer. Three trials were run for each diet treatment and swimming velocity was measured for each run to calculate standard metabolic rate (LFD: 135.70 +\/-42.79 mg O2\/kg\/hr; HFD: 147.54+\/-8.89 mg O2\/kg\/hr;p=0.80). Whole tank metabolic rate was measured using T2 as an Open-system respirometer with help from the dissolved oxygen monitoring system (Program Logic Control) operated by Monterey Bay Aquarium. Stomach temperature was measured by minilog temperature probes and no significant difference between diets was measured (pre-feed: p-0.91; post-feed: p=0.80).","630":"Sphingolipid signaling cascades play a role in regulating egg maturation and differentiation in a variety of organisms. To determine if a similar mechanism is involved in fertilization, S. purpuratus gamates were treated with cell-permeable ceramide. It was found to reduce sperm motility, decrease sperm-egg binding, and inhibit fertilization. This effect was stereospecific and could not be mimicked by a ceramide analog differing from ceramide by only a double bond. These results suggest a role for ceramide signaling in regulating sea urchin fertilization.","631":"Stimulation of N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells with the neurotransmitter bradykinin (Bk) leads to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and calcium release from IP3-regulated Ca2+ pools located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This involves a specific G-protein second messenger cascade. The release of intracellular Ca2+ is preceded by a latent period of up to 30 seconds. This study investigated the contribution of IP3 diffusion and the dynamics of IP3 receptor activation to the latency between surface receptor binding and Ca2+ release. Intracellular injection of caged IP3 plus the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 was used investigate the basis of the observed latency. Following injection, cells were exposed to a brief (170ms) flash of light (230 joules, 360nm wavelength) to photolyse the caged compound. Fluorescence video imaging was used to follow the change in intracellular [Ca2+]. The study showed that [Ca2+] begins to rise immediately (within 200ms) following uncaging of IP3 by flash photolysis, and reaches maximum levels within 1.5 seconds. The result indicates that neither IP3 diffusion to its receptors nor delay between IP3R activation and Ca2+ release contribute significantly to overall latency. Analysis of Ca2+ wave kinetics shows that in contrast to cells stimulated with neurotransmitter, injected cells do not exhibit propagation of Ca2+ waves following photolysis of caged IP3. This observation suggests that the IP3 receptor is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the soma and major neurites. Ca2+ waves apparently travel through this IP3 receptor rich medium. The constant rate in which Ca2+ waves travel shows that propagation is an active process rather than a diffusional process. The mechanism of propagation could involve either IP3 production or Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release at the wave front.","632":"Although many learning experiments on cephalopods have been carried out with octopus, little is known about the learning ability of a close relative, the cuttlefish. The capability of two common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, to associate either a flashing light or a constant light with a reward of food was explored in this experiment. One animal was presented with both a flashing and a constant light and had to choose the constant light in order to receive the reward. In a simpler experiment, the other experimental animal was presented with a flashing light and simply needed to react to the light to receive the reward. Over the course of the trials, the animal in both experiments showed significant increases in responses focused on the light associated with reward (p 0.001 for the choice experiment; p 0.05 for the simple experiment).","633":"Loligo opalescens migrates vertically, experiencing large temperature changes in short amounts of time. Loligo depends on jet-propulsion for escape behavior, and at 12 degrees C shows an escape response that uses coordination between two motor systems employing giant and non-giant neural fibers. Little is known about escape behavior at colder temperatures, however, and experiments were done to determine how this behavior changed over the biologically relevant temperature range of 12 -4 degrees C. Squid were restrained and recordings of stellar nerve activity and intra-mantle pressure transients were taken during escape behavior elicited by strobe flash stimuli. As temperature decreased, pressure showed an increase in amplitude and duration, as well as an introduction of a plateau followed by a slower increase in amplitude below a critical transition temperature at 8 -10 degrees C. Neural recordings suggest that these findings may be due to both the introduction of two giant axon spikes at the transition temperature, as well as an increase in small fiber activity at lower temperatures. In free-swimming squid, these changes are manifested as a longer period of propulsive thrust which moves the squid a larger distance in a given time. These findings suggest that Loligo is able to maintain performance at colder temperatures through coordination of the giant and non-giant motor systems in a way that is similar to, yet distinct from, that at warmer temperatures.","634":"Pharmacology and site-based mutagenesis probe function of ion channels by altering specific sites and observing changes in channel\n properties. Previous studies by Spires and Begenisich (1990) showed that external diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), a chemical modifier of histidine, irreversibly reduces and slows potassium current in squid giant axons. Examination of the amino acid sequence of the SqKv1A channel thought to correspond to the axonal delayed rectifier K+ channel reveals a putative external DEPC target at histidine 351 (H351) near the pore. To examine the role of this residue in the DEPC effect, various Kv1 channels were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and tested for DEPC sensitivity. It was hypothesized that this histidine is necessary for the DEPC effect.\n Although it was found that K+ channels with the proposed critical residue exhibited a reduction in peak current after DEPC application, similar effects were seen in clones lacking the histidine near the external mouth of the pore. These cloned channels did have other external histidines, however. Additionally, DEPC slowed the activation kinetics of nearly all tested clones, in some cases without a corresponding decrease in current amplitude. It was concluded that while modification of histidine residues in Kv1 channels affects functional properties, all effects cannot be attributed to modification of the residue equivalent to\n H351 in squid.","635":"The N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cell line was used to investigate the role of the cholinergic receptor\/nitric oxide\/cyclic GMP pathway in regulating neurite outgrowth. Here evidence is presented that both carbachol and 9-Bromo-cGMP inhibit neurite outgrowth. Nitric oxide donors, however, promote various forms of neurite outgrowth. DEANO and Spermine NONOate were shown to promote neurite outgrowth from lamellipodia, but had no effect on neurites that did not possess lamellipodia before administration of the donors. SNAP was shown to allow growth of the main shafts of neurites, but not that of lamellipodia or their extended neurites. This study suggests that nitric oxide promotes growth through a cGMP-independent pathway. During activation of cholinergic receptors, the stimulatory effects of nitric oxide appear to be masked by other pathways in the cholinergic cascade.","636":"The resistance of Loligo opalescens embryos to predation may be due to symbiotic bacteria which colonize the egg sheath. It has been hypothesized that these symbiotic microbes are transferred to the egg sheath from the accessory nidamental (AN) gland of the mature female. Cultures of bacteria from freshly spawned egg sheath tissue have produced two to three morphological types of bacteria. Sheath and gland isolates of the same morphology were shown to express identical patterns of protease activity, antifungal activity, and H2 S production. Whole cell hybridizations of purified sheath bacteria with 16 s rDNA probes supports the hypothesis that one sheath isolate is the same species as a previously characterized AN gland isolate. RPD PCR analysis confirms the correlation between sheath and gland isolates by showing both produce similar genomic fingerprints. Comparative analysis of 16s r DNA sequences verifies this homology between sheath and gland isolates, indicating vertical transmission of the AN gland symbionts to the egg sheath during spawning.","637":"Geographic range, extent of red muscle, supra-hepatic rete size, and limited temperature measurements have placed the salmon shark, Lamna ditropis, as the warmest of the lamnid sharks. Yet its anatomy has remained largely undescribed, and measurements of brain or eye temperatures in particular have not been taken. In this study, three specimens were examined to determine if the morphological requirements for a warm brain and eyes are present. In addition to local heat-producing red muscle of the eye and jaw, other notable features were found. A well-developed orbital rete lies within a venous sinus on both sides of the cranium. Cool, oxygenated blood from the gills can pass through the dividing vessels of this exchanger before reaching the brain or eyes. Since venous blood in the sinus flows opposite the arterial blood, counter-current heat exchange can occur. A vein originating in the red swimming muscle potentially contributes to the warmth of the venous sinus by supplying blood directly from the warmest part of the shark. Before collecting in the orbital sinus, this red muscle vein bathes the brain in warm blood. These morphological data suggest the salmon shark has a significant capacity to warm the brain and eyes.","638":"A photoprotective role has been ascribed to the ultraviolet radiation-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) present in the follicle cells surrounding eggs of the tunicate Ascidia ceratodes. Studies were performed using natural sunlight and a variety of wavelength filters to expose intact Ascidia eggs and eggs in which the MAA-containing follicle cells had been removed to various types of ultraviolet radiation. The kinetics of development were examined to ascertain whether the follicle cells were acting to protect the eggs from UV damage. This series of studies demonstrated that at ambient solar radiation levels there are no observable differences in rates of early development between Ascidia embryos where follicle cells were removed and embryos with an intact follicle cell layer. This study suggests that the tunicate embryo has a variety of defenses against UV damage, and the defensive role played by mycosporine-like amino acids may not be of primary importance.","639":"Protein thermal stability in archeogastropod snails distributed along a vertical intertidal\/subtidal gradient was investigated to determine whether a correlation exists between habitat temperature and enzyme stability. Assays were run for the following enzymes: malate dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate kinase (Pk), aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT). A positive correlation between habitat temperature and enzyme stability was found in MDH and PK, a negative correlation was found in GDH and AAT, and no correlation was observed in aldolase. Since thermal stability is a macroscopic measurement of protein structure, further studies involving protein function (kinetics) and the effect of the intracellular microenvironment are needed to further elucidate the relationship between habitat temperature and protein adaptation.","640":"Kvbeta subunits associate with alpha subunits and cause changes in both properties (Kvbeta1) and expression level (Kvbeta2) of Kv potassium channels. Kvbeta1 has been noted to increase channel inactivation rates when co-expressed with Kvalpha. Increases in glycosylation efficiency and surface protein expression of alpha subunits have been observed in the presence of Kvbeta2. A partial Kvbeta cDNA clone (Sqbeta) was isolated form a squid stellate ganglion cDNA library and tentatively identified as a beta2 type. In situ hybridization was used to examine Sqbeta mRNA distribution in adult, hatchling, and embryonic squid. In optic lobes, RNA probe specific for Sqbeta preferentially labeled cellular layers containing somata of secondary and tertiary visual neurons, bipolar cells, and large amacrine cells. Based on grain density counts, Sqbeta was present in nearly all medullar cells of post-embryonic squid. In stage 29+ embryos, Sqbeta grain density was noticeable lower than in adults and hatchlings. Kvbeta subunits may be expressed in different cells at various levels during development, adding another level of regulation and possibly playing an important role in increasing Kv channel diversity.","641":"The mussel Mytilus californianus is able to remove a wide array of xenobiotics (toxins) from its cells using an ATP-driven transport protein. This multixenobiotic resistance (MXR)system, similar to the multidrug transport protein found in human tumor cells, is thought to be a first line of defense against many natural and anthropogenic toxins. Three Monterey Bay seaweed species and three Monterey Bay phytoplankton species were found to contain likely substrates for the MXR protein. Extracts from all six species showed an increase in intracellular fluorescence using the rhodamine B accumulation, indicating that these contain substrates for the MXR protein. Mussels are filter feeders that remove seaweed particulates, phytoplankton, and their byproducts from the waters that pass over them. If the mussel diet contains compounds that are substrates for the MXR protein, this would provide insight into the pressures resulting in selection for this transporter, a mechanism that is a useful defense mechanism in today's polluted waters.","642":"As the first step in investigating the Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) as a model system for studying the acquisition of swimming behavior and underlying neural activity in teleost fish, we studied the changes in the swimming behavior, anatomy of motoneurons, and muscle activation throughout the larval developmental period. The larval period lasts just 12 days, during which there is rapid development of locomotion. At 12 days post fertilization (dpf), bonito undergo a rapid metamorphosis to the juvenile stage. The short, 12-day developmental period suggests rapid development and organization of the motoneuron and motor system. Swimming behavior was videotaped for five fish in each day, and analyzed by determining a time budget for active time and determining maximum body flexion exhibited by each fish. Motoneurons were fluorescently labeled with DiI and muscle activity was recorded using electromyography. Locomotion is initially produced using the trunk and develops to include use of the full tail and tip of the tail. Early in development, larval bonito spend the majority of their time inactive but sustained swimming periods become more common as the fish develops. Maximum body flexion did not appear to change with development. The number of motoneurons increased from less than 10 to over 30 cell bodies per segment. We also observed two types of motoneurons which differed in morphology. Cell bodies also appeared to develop in tiers until they were of the same size. Motoneuron development first took place in more rostral segments of the fish with the number and complexity of the motoneurons decreasing toward caudal segments. Signals obtained from EMG recordings appeared to correspond to the basic swimming modes of rapid bursts and longer duration swimming using tail beats. We cannot draw a direct correlation between swimming behavior, motoneuron anatomy, and muscle activity based on the data obtained thus far, however, we have shown that development of bonito swimming behavior is associated with rapid development of the motoneuron system and muscle activity which correlates to swimming mode.","643":"The viscera of Bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, are warm, and internal temperatures as high as 25 degrees C have been recorded in 5 degrees C water (Block, pers. comm.). The source of this heat and the visceral site of vascular heat conservation are not clear. Measurements taken after feeding of Bluefin implicate the caecum as the warmest visceral organ, however, little is known about the general anatomy of the tuna caecum or its method of heat production. Specimens of yellowfin, Thunnus albacares, and blackfin, Thunnus atlanticus, were used to study the anatomy, histology, and aerobic capacity of the tuna caecum. Anatomical comparisons were also made to the bonito, Sarda chiliensis, an ectothermic relative of the tuna. Injections of silicon into the caecum vasculature detected a parallel array of arteries and veins throughout the organ. Measurements of citrate synthase activity, an enzymatic indicator of tissue metabolic capacity, show a high degree of caecum metabolic activity, around 20 units\/g tissue at 25 degrees C. This value is 4-5 fold greater than tuna white anaerobic muscle, but not as high as the aerobic red muscle. The high heat contribution from aerobic activity, along with that contributed by digestive processes within the caecum and stomach, may be able to account for much of the heat production within the viscera. The endothermic nature of the organ and the parallel architecture of the vasculature suggest that countercurrent heat exchange can occur. An increased visceral temp would lead to faster digestion and provide a continuous source of fuel for the tuna's high metabolic needs.","644":"I monitored recruitment of the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus spp. to the intertidal zone at three sites in central California. The sampling period was April 27th-May 28th 1998, during the strong 1997-8 El Nino. The results showed that one large pulse of recruitment occurred at Waddell Beach during a relaxation of coastal upwelling in April. Two smaller recruitment events occurred at Asilomar Beach during two periods of relaxation in May. There was a significant correlation of recruitment with sea surface temperature at two moored buoys (r^2=.593, r^2=.604) and salinity (r^2=-.593). Buoy observations of north wind velocity and sea surface temperature showed that the two periods of reduced upwelling in May totaled nine days. Only five months during April through June 1988-1997 had nine or more days without upwelling-favorable north winds. This suggests that one effect of the El Nino on the central coast may have been to decrease upwelling-favorable winds.","645":"Heat shock proteins are one type of molecular chaperone. Their primary responsibility is to help refold proteins that are denatured due to high temperatures. These proteins are essential for organisms living at the edges of their thermal ranges, for example, many intertidal organisms which may be exposed to potentially lethal temperatures during low tide periods. An example of such an intertidal organism is the mussel Mytilus californianus, which is found in both subtidal and intertidal locations, and can often experience temperatures of 30 degrees C and higher. Such temperatures were seen in the two artificial tide pools, one subtidal and one intertidal, which were created for this study. Equal numbers of M. californianus ranging in size were placed in the two pools and samples were collected over five weeks.","646":"The marine prosobranch gastropod Calliostoma canaliculatum secretes a noxious substance, Yellow Stuff (YS), as a mechanism of chemical defense against predatory sea stars. The effects of YS from the homogenized hypobranchial gland on voltage-gated K+ channels were characterized with voltage clamp techniques for multiple subfamilies of cloned K+ channels expressed in three different cell systems (insect Sf9 cells, mammalian HEK 293 cells, and Xenopus oocytes). The most profound effect was slowed activation kinetics with very little change to deactivation kinetics. Other effects included a decrease in peak conductance and a shift in the voltage-dependence of peak conductance to more positive potentials. YS secretion collected from electrical stimulation of the hypobranchial gland gave the same effects. Fractionation of YS produced one active fraction that produced effects similar to that of the unfractionated YS. Elucidating the mechanism by which YS mediates its effects and further establishing its selectivity for different K+ channel isoforms will provide a useful tool for further studying voltage-gated K+ channels.","647":"Many marine organisms possess a multitoxin, or multixenobiotic, defense mechanism that enables their cells to resist the effects of a variety of environmental pollutants. A membrane transport protein similar to the multidrug resistance protein (MDR) in human tumor cells pumps moderately hydrophobic compounds out of the cell membrane, thus conferring a multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) to cells. One particular strain of marine bacteria isolated from the digestive gland of the mussel Mytilus californianus produces or contains compounds that are potential substrates of the MXR protein in mussel gill tissue. Substances produced by this strain increased the level of rhodamine accumulation in gill tissue and reduced the rate of rhodamine efflux when compared with a marine broth control. This strain was isolated separately from two different mussels collected more than seven weeks apart, indicating that it is endogenous to the mussel gut, either as a regularly ingested dietary bacteria or as a digestive symbiont. The presence of the strain in the mussel digestive gland and its high affinity for MXR suggests a possible evolutionary function for the MXR transporter may be to protect against potential toxins that the mussel encounters during the digestive process.","648":"Developmental changes in the swimming behavior and the underlying muscular function and motoneural anatomy in the Pacific Bonito, Sarda chiliensis, were investigated in the course of the first twelve days of post-hatch development of the fish. Quantitative observations of behavior revealed peaks in activity at days 8 and 12 of development. Analysis of maximum body angle while turning showed no trend towards decreasing or increasing flexibility of the fish (f-value=18.4,r^2=.26), even though Bonito use different amounts of flexion while swimming in different stages of development. Motoneurons in the spinal cord from days 2 through 7 are organized into tiers: one tier was seen on days 2 and 3, two tiers on days 5 and 6, and three tiers on day 7. Tier distinction decreases as the fish grow older, and tiers are no longer distinguishable on day 11. Spinal cord cells are also divided into two categories - cells in pattern A tend to be larger and extend their axons ventrally to a fiber tract which travels parallel to the spinal cord and then veers to form the ventral root, while pattern B cells are smaller and extend their axons directly to their ventral root. Finally, neuritic connections between cells were seen in early days and multiplied with age. In later fish, extensive swellings were seen in the ventral roots and neurites of the spinal cord. Electrophysiology studies revealed that on day 7, the motor units of the fish began to fire in sustained low frequency series' reminiscent of the tail beat in continuous swimming. Also on day 7, variable pattern of firing was observed for the first time. These data correlate acquisition of swimming behavior with increased complexity of motoneurons and greater sophistication of muscle activity. Understanding Bonito's striking development is a step towards developing a well-characterized model system for the study of the acquisition of swimming in teleosts.","649":"Thermal adaptation at the biochemical level has been demonstrated in previous studies of bony fishes and other vertebrates. One criterion that has been used to assess the possible presence of thermal adaptation is the Michaelis-Menten constant, or Km. Km has been shown to be conserved among teleosts and some other vertebrates within their physiological temperature ranges. One possible mechanism by which homologous proteins may conserve Km at extreme temperatures is by changes in primary structure. The relationship between temperature adaptation and changes in primary structure has been explored in teleosts, but has yet to be studied in elasmobranchs. In this study, the variation of pyruvate Km with temperature and the deduced amino acid sequences of four elasmobranch A4-LDH orthologs were compared. Both the subtropical and the cold temperate species of sharks were found to display conservation of pyruvate Km over physiological temperature ranges, while the subtropical and the antarctic species of rays did not. The deduced amino acid sequences of the shark enzymes exhibited different regions of variability than the LDH's of teleosts previously studied, while the sequences of the ray enzymes exhibited similar regions of variability to those of teleost orthologs. It was concluded that there may a limited number of sites at which temperature adaptation in A4-LDH occurs, and that even closely related organisms do not necessarily use the same sequence changes to adapt to extreme temperatures.","650":"Past studies have found that the black turban snail, Tegula funebralis, exhibits a shore-level size gradient, with mean shell size either increasing or decreasing in a down-shore direction, at different sites. Predation has been implicated as a driving factor. A shore-level size gradient was found at Monterey Bay, CA. Snails > 15 mm were more abundant than other size classes in the Low intertidal zone, while snails 9 - 15 mm were the most abundant class in the Mid zone, and snails \u00a3 9 mm were the most abundant class in the High zone. Mean size increased in a down-shore direction. The study site had virtually no Pisaster ochraceus, a known predator.","651":"Zebrafish, Danio rerio, are a useful model system for vertebrate cardiovascular research. Their transparent bodies during the larval stage of development allow for in vivo experimentation. Pharmacological experimentation reveals important similarities between zebrafish hearts and those of mammals. Muscarinic cholinergic receptor activity was demonstrated through the dose dependent decrease in heart rate caused by the acetylcholine analog carbachol. Adrenergic receptor responses were elicited by norepinephrine and isoproterenol. The inhibition of intracellular calcium release channels by ryanodine also had a decelerating effect on heart rate, as did the disruption of sodium-potassium active pumps by ouabain. The stimulation of an undefined nitric oxide pathway by two nitric oxide donors also slowed heart rate. Clearly, the pharmacologic responses of the zebrafish heart should be further explored as a model for vertebrate cardiovascular physiology and as a foundation for research in the genetics and cardiovascular development of zebrafish.","652":"The presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) was recently discovered in the tissues of some Antarctic notothenioid fishes. This discovery raises the questions of whether the effects of TMAO on protein function vary with temperature and whether TMAO plays the same role in notothenioids as it does in elasmobranchs. Two temperature-sensitive kinetic properties - apparent Km of pyruvate and kcat - of muscle A4-LDH in Gillichthys mirabilis, a warm-temperature fish with negligible amounts of TMAO in its cells, and Parachaenichthys charcoti, an Antarctic fish, are not significantly affected by the presence of 150 mM TMAO at most temperatures from 0 degrees to 30 degrees C. The presence of TMAO did not appear to significantly affect the loss of activity in the LDH of any of the five teleost species studied over a period of 24 days. The Vmax of the LDH reaction in these species was slightly inhibited by 150 mM TMAO at both 0 degrees and 20 degrees C. TMAO may function by increasing the rigidity of the enzyme at hinge regions which play a role in establishing the rates of conformational change.","653":"This project focused on the development of an anesthetic regimen in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), bonito (Sarda chiliensis), and Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), while monitoring effects on blood chemistry and hematology. Anesthesia was induced with a combination of ketamine and medetomidine, and compared to MS-222 (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester). Ketamine and medetomidine were injected into the red muscle of fish, while MS-222 was applied by immersing a fish in a drug and seawater solution. Effects of anesthesia were monitored and blood samples were taken. Blood was then analyzed for hematocrit, hemoglobin, enzymes, metabolites and ions. Survivorship between the species varied, with yellowfin tuna at 0% survival and bonito the highest at 50% survival. A trend relating an increase in time of the anesthetic induction period to decreasing metabolic rate was noted. Additionally, time until recovery from anesthesia was found to increase with the ratio of ketamine to medetomidine in yellowfin tuna, but was found to decrease with the ratio of the two drugs in bonito. Anesthesia was found to have no effect on average yellowfin tuna hematocrit (mean level = 33.4 + or - 2.2). However, a positive relationship between yellowfin tuna hematocrit and medetomidine dose was noted (r^2 = 0.82729). A negative relationship between bonito hematocrit and the ratio of ketamine to medetomidine was also present. A significant increase in ions (calcium, chloride, potassium and sodium) and some enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase) was noted in yellowfin and was most likely due to the high levels of activity associated with anesthesia induction. Further studies into this form of intramuscular anesthesia are needed, both to better determine the feasibility of usage of the drugs in yellowfin tuna, and to ascertain an ideal anesthetic dose in bonito and mackerel.","654":"The channeled top snail, Calliostoma canaliculatum, releases a yellow mucous, called yellow stuff or YS, in response to perturbation and especially attempted predation from sea stars such as Pycnopodia hellantholdes (Bryan et al., 1997). The source of YS is the hypobranchial gland. Therefore, anatomical studies of this gland as well as electrical stimulation experiments, to visualize secretion from this organ, were performed. The anatomical study divulges the existence of cells that contain numerous large vesicles that appear to contain yellow stuff. Stimulation of the gland directly as well as other body sites with an electrode reveals that a one second train of brief shocks with a repeat frequency of 20Hz is sufficient to cause secretion of YS. Stimulated secretion was reversibly abolished by low Ca2+ seawater. These stimulation experiments demonstrate that the secretion of YS is under neuronal control. Finally, from the trends that were visualized in the anatomical study and from a consideration of the time course of secretion, holocrine secretion is proposed to be the method by which YS is released from the yellow cells of the hypobranchial gland.","655":"Biochemistry is usually carried out under in vitro conditions that do not closely approximate those found in vivo. Molecular crowding, resulting from high intracellular protein concentrations, has been shown to affect macromolecular function (Garner & Burg, 1994). To study this effect, the thermal stabilities of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoforms of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle, were studied under simulated in vivo conditions of high protein concentration. The mitochondrion contains much higher protein concentrations than those found in the cytoplasm; protein crystals have been used to model the mitochondrial matrix (Srere, 1981). The mitochondrial isoform of MDH (mMDH) showed substantial stability enhancement in media crowded with bovine serum albumin, a model protein. The cytoplasmic isoform (cMDH), which is more thermally stable than the mitochondrial isoform, exhibited no significant enhancement of stability in crowded media. This difference can be seen as an adaptation to local protein concentration. mMDH must be more flexible to function well in a more crowded medium, rendering it less thermally stable and more responsive to the stabilizing effects of a crowding agent. In order to study enzyme function, which is closely related to stability, apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km's) and Vmax's were determined in crowded and viscous conditions for the LDH of three species. The LDH of Parachaenichthys charcoti , an Antarctic fish, appears less susceptible to the effects of agents that slow enzyme function than two homologous enzymes from organisms that maintain a warmer body temperature. LDH from colder temperature organisms appears to be more flexible than LDH from organisms adapted to warm temperatures (Fields and Somero, in prep). This flexibility may explain the results obtained.","656":"The Hewatt transect is a permanently marked area perpendicular to shore running through the protected rocky intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station. Species abundance data collected in 1933-37 and 1993-95 showed a significant difference for many species during the intervening years. In order to determine how representative the Hewatt transect is of the protected rocky intertidal zone at Hopkins, a 90 x 15 m area surrounding the Hewatt transect was compared to three adjacent areas of the same size. Three organisms were sampled in two or three 15-m transects within each of the four areas. Ten quadrats were counted in each transect. Additionally, the substrate rugosity for each area was measured. For Anthopleura sola, a solitary anemone, there were significant differences among areas (P=.02), but not among transects-within-areas (P=.16). For Serpulorbis squamigerus, a tube dwelling gastropod, there were no significant differences at either level (P=.15 and .15). For the alga Endocladia muricata, there were no significant differences among areas (P=.23), but highly significant differences among transects-within-areas (P<<.001). Substrate rugosity showed no significance between areas (P=.72). These data indicate that while there are some differences between the Hewatt area and adjacent areas, there is no evidence that the Hewatt area is non-representative of the HMS intertidal. While the intertidal zone is certainly not homogeneous, it is possible to conclude that the changes seen in the 60 year interval were due to significant species abundance change and not stochastic variation. Additionally, the environmental processes that caused these changes are likely to have influenced the distribution of organisms across the intertidal zone.","657":"Foraging behavior of Ocenebra circumtexta, an abundant predatory gastropod in the intertidal zone at Hopkins Marine Station, was studied. Ocenebra in the field were observed consuming barnacles, small limpets, tube worms, and mussels, with two barnacles, Tetraclita squamosa and Chthamalus spp. composing 85% of their diet. As a population, Ocenebra appear to be consuming prey proportional to its abundance in the field. This is consistent with a theory of random prey selection. However, snails marked and monitored over a five week period through 2 to 4 feeding cycles showed consistency in prey choice that differed from the population average. Prey items chosen by each individual were also consistent with a particular vertical zone in the intertidal. Ocenebra occur vertically from the subtidal to approximately +5 feet. This range encompasses 3 major zones, divided according to domination by algae, Tetraclita, or Chthamalus. Marked snails remained within the vertical zone corresponding to their choice of prey at a much higher rate than would be expected if the individuals moved about randomly. Two possible conclusions are that Ocenebra stratify according to prey type in the vertical zone, or that Ocenebra stratify for non-foraging reasons. Evidence for the former is that in tanks with 4 types of prey items, all 8 individuals monitored throughout 3 to 5 feeding cycles chose prey consistent with a specific zone in the intertidal. This supports a correlation between zonation and prey choice in Ocenebra. This could imply that learning, conditioning, or genetic variation is present in Ocenebra circumtexta, and could lead to a competitive advantage over other predatory snails in the intertidal.","658":"During development, organisms must establish properly functioning and well coordinated sensory and motor systems in order to survive. Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis), pelagic fishes belonging to the tuna family, undergo a relatively rapid developmental transformation in the <24-hour period after hatching. The two major morphological changes that occur are enlargement of the jaw and pigmentation of the eye (retinal ephithelium). In addition, dramatic behavioral changes take place. For example, early (stage L1) animals frequently exhibit fast start escape responses, while in the later stage (L2), more controlled sustained swimming movements are present. L1 larvae are also more sensitive to touch and vibration stimuli than L2. To test the hypothesis that the emerging visual system changes the activity of descending motor systems, I recorded field potentials in the hindbrain and spinal cord during this developmental period. Recordings of spontaneous activity showed that there was essentially no difference between L1 and L2 larvae, either in the light or dark. The same was true for L2 larvae reared in the dark. Looking at the strong visual stimuli, larvae reared in dark exhibit a movement response but recover more slowly than those reared under normal (daylight) conditions. This finding suggests that dark rearing negatively affects the sensitivity of the developing visual system, however appropriate connections with the hindbrain still appear to be made. Based on these observations, it appears that visual inputs might be sufficient to modify the activity of an identified reflex circuit, and more specific experiments are warranted to identify the physiological basis for this change.","659":"Cone snails are predatory marine gastropods of the genus Conus which proliferated to over 500 species worldwide largely through the use of novel peptide toxins (conotoxins) that are injected into prey items through a harpooning apparatus. Conotoxins have evolved for maximal effect on prey species hunted by each cone snail species (Duda and Palumbi, 1999). All cone snail venoms examined thus far contain peptides that act with great specificity on a variety of channels including K+, Na+, Ca2+, and ACh receptors (Olivera et al, 1999). Conus californicus is indigenous to the California coastline. Venom samples were collected by extruding the contents of one venom duct into 0.5 ml external recording solution and were further diluted during experiments. Voltage-depenent K+ currents were recorded from Shaker B K+ channels, in which both N- and C-type inactivation were eliminated, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. When applied to the bathing solution, the venom was found to induce rapid inactivation of Ik. K+ current was reduced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that fits satisfactorily with a simple model of open-channel block that applies to tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium (QA) that block K+ channels at the inner mouth of the channel, but only after the channel has opened following a voltage step. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the venom acting on the external side of the membrane. First, the venom interacts with externally applied tetraethylammonium (TEA). an impermeant QA. An internal blocker would be expected to be unaffected by external TEA. Second, recovery from venom-induced Ik block is similar to that from QA-block in its dependence on voltage, but different from QA in that recovery shows no acceleration in solutions with elevated external K= concentration. Lack of this effect suggests that the venom component in question is not acting to block internally, because it cannot be dislodged by inward Ik negative voltages. Third, channel-blocking action was preserved following dialysis of the venom at a 3500-molecular weight cut off. This suggests a large molecule such as a peptide is the active component.","660":"In the rocky intertidal of the Monterey region, the slipper limpet Crepidula adunca is a common inhabitant of the shells of Tegula funebralis. In the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, 13% of Tegula funebralis are host to Crepidula adunca. Sixty-three percent of Crepidula are found alone on Tegula shells, while 37% of Crepidula are on Tegula that are host to at least one other Crepidula as well. Initial lab experiments to determine movement rate of Crepidula between hosts showed that 16% of Crepidula moved at least once, 100% of whom were male. Experiments were then set up to determine what motivated male Crepidula to move. Males were removed from their original hosts and reattached on new hosts, then placed in replicate tanks containing Tegula with either no Crepidula or specific combinations of male and\/or female Crepidula. Results of 19 replicates show that on average, 48% of Crepidula movements were to Tegula containing female Crepidula, 33% were to Tegula containing no Crepidula, and only 12% were to Tegula containing only male Crepidula. Results suggest that movement of male Crepidula was influenced by the presence of female Crepidula on the host snail, but this can not be isolated as the sole cause of movement. Other factors in Crepidula movement, such as overall abundance of male Crepidula on a host snail and chance events (such as rate of Tegula movement and Crepidula encounter) remain to be investigated.","661":"The intertidal red alga\u202d \u202cMastocarpus papillatus was sampled for genetic diversity in three populations from central and southern California. M. papillatus can exhibit an asexual apomictic life history, with female gametes giving rise to female gametophytes. A higher proportion of this asexual reproduction occurs in populations in central California and further north (Zupan and West, 1988). It is therefore hypothesized that the geographic variation in life history should affect the population structure of \u272d\u270e \u2750\u2741\u2750\u2749\u25cf\u25cf\u2741\u25bc\u25c6\u25b2. DNA was extracted from haploid female gametophytes and then fingerprinted using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique (Vos et al., 1995). A bootstrapped consensus tree was constructed using parsimony. Localities were shown to have distinct population fingerprints. Greater population structure was found in the northern, more asexually reproducing populations, but this was most likely due to sampling methods. No definite link was found between the life history and population genetics.\u202c\u202c\u202c","662":"Tityustoxin block of wild type and mutant SqKV1A channels from Loligo opalesceus neurons was studied in Xenopus oocytes using the two electrode voltage clamp method. The mutant channel was created by replacing a histidine residue at position 351 on the outer vestibule with a glycine. Wild type channels show greatly reduced sensitivity to tityustoxin block at pH 6. The glycine mutant's sensitivity to tydioustoxin was not pH dependent. Block of both the wild type and mutant channels proved to be voltage dependent. Kd values ranged from 14 nm at 0 mv to 70 nm at 100 mv for both channels. K-on rates of H351 channels were not effected by voltage, whereas K-on rates of wild-type channels decreased slightly with voltage. K-off rates increased as voltage increased in both types of channels. Results suggests that a charged residue on the toxin enters the channel pore when tityustoxin blocks these channels, making the toxin sensitive to the membrane voltage.","663":"Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are currently managed as two separate stocks, one breeding in the Mediterranean Sea and the other in the Gulf of Mexico. The fidelity of the two stocks to their respective breeding ground is currently in question. In the Gulf of Mexico, bluefin arrive in a sexually inactive state and in some time period ranging from weeks to months, develop into spawners. This western stock is reported to mature at about 190-205 cm in length and about 8-10 years of age. Currently, bluefin tuna are being tagged with pop-up satellite and archival tags, to discern their migratory movements and philopatry to a spawning ground. My objective was to examine bluefin in the areas they are currently being tagged, to discern the state of sexual maturity of fish in the different regions. Specifically, I was interested in identifying 1) what is the minimum size of first sexual activity and 2) if spawners were restricted only to the Gulf of Mexico. Knowing which fish are mature will help to interpret the movement and behaviors revealed by the tag data. Since scombrid fishes are closely related, other species provided a valuable comparison. To histologically identify the stages of wild caught bluefin tuna I compared the tissues to yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) held in captivity at the Tuna Research and Conservation Center. Based on a classification system from previous studies, I assigned each sample a stage of maturity. In addition, for captive fish, I collected data on gonad size at mortality, which provided an index of gonad development for corroboration with histological examinations. I found that female yellowfin tuna do not become sexually active in water temperatures below 20 degrees C, but male yellowfin do, with no apparent variation in size to first sexual maturity from wild caught yellowfin tuna. Female yellowfin at 25 degrees C showed slightly more advanced oocytes than females at 20 degrees C. Both sexes of bonito become mature in captivity and spawn in 20 degrees C water. Together, histological observations of the captive populations reveal all the stages of gonadal development needed to classify scombrid gonad samples. Based on comparative histological analyses, I concluded that all bluefin gonadal tissues (n=111) from New England and North Carolina were inactive and therefore not spawning. All fish from the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas (n=5) demonstrated asynchronous ovaries with many oocytes yolked and in maturation stages just prior to spawning. The lack of a fully hydrated oocyte, indicative of a currently spawning fish is probably due to the small sample size and time of capture. The Bahama fish represent the first histological observations of sexually active bluefin tuna outside the Gulf of Mexico. Understanding the reproductive biology and the size at first spawning is a crucial step for developing future management strategies.","664":"Gillichthys mirabilis (the long-jawed mudsucker, Family Gobiidae), acclimated to 14\u00baC, were exposed to different periods of hypoxia. I selected the hypoxia intensity based on critical oxygen concentration (Pcrit) data obtained from three fish, all of whom displayed Pcrit of 1.0 mg\/L. I placed experimental fish in a consistent oxygen concentration of 0.8 mg\/L, and sacrificed them after 0, 8, 24 and 72 hours of exposure by freeze-clamping in liquid nitrogen. I examined glycogen, lactate and ethanol concentrations in white muscle, liver, heart and brain. I found no ethanol in any tissue. Lactate accumulated significantly and similarly in all tissues throughout the time course. Glycogen changed significantly only in liver, which had very large initial stores (6.87 \u00b1 1.46 mg\/g), and drastically depleted stores by 8 hours (0.59 \u00b1 0.22 mg\/g). White muscle had consistently low glycogen (mean 0.27 \u00b1 0.01 mg\/g). Brain showed some hints of glycogen depletion (p = 0.053) by 72 hours. I conclude that during hypoxia in Gillichthys mirabilis, glycogen is mobilized from stores in the liver and transported to meet the energy demands of brain, heart and white muscle, which conserve their own glycogen.","665":"Changes in the activity of glycolytic enzymes in response to hypoxic stress has been observed in many different species\u202d. \u202cI examined the enzymatic response of\u202d \u202cGillichthys mirabilis (common name: longjawed mudsucker; family Gobiidae) to hypoxia.

Previous work has resulted in the cultivation, isolation, and characterization of two dominant bacterial strains (genera Shewanella and Roseobacter) from homogenates of egg case sheath and accessory nidamental gland.\n QUESTIONS\n Do these cultivated isolates accurately represent the diversity of the sheath bacterial community? Are there bacteria present in the sheaths that are not cultivatable and therefore have not been described or characterized? What are the numbers of bacteria in the sheaths and what percent of these can be cultured?\n RESULTS\n In order to obtain release of the bacteria from the sheath for quantitative enumeration, a means of disrupting the tough egg sheath was developed using sodium periodate and glass beads. Total bacterial counts ranged between 10(8) and 10(9) bacterial per sheath which is slightly higher than the 10(6) to 10(8) estimated by Biggs and Epel (1991) with electron microscopy. A live\/dead staining assay with DAPI and propidium iodide indicated about 68% of bacteria in sheath homogenate were alive. Serial dilutions of the native sheath homogenate were plated on various culture media and colony forming units were counted. Using comparison of direct bacterial counts from the homogenate, the viability stain, and the number of colony forming units on plates, the percent of bacteria cultivatable was found to be between 30 and 50%.\n CONCLUSIONS\n Because a significant portion of the bacteria were not cultivatable, further investigation of egg sheath bacteria may be necessary to adequetely describe its diversity and composition.","667":"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) have been found in measurable amounts in receiving waters. These non-priority aquatic pollutants may act in unexpected and potentially biohazardous ways. One of the more prevalent PPCPs is a perfume ingredient, musk ketone (1-tert.-butyl-3,5-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-4-acetylbenzene). I tested musk ketone for its ability to modulate the accumulation and efflux of xenobiotics known to be substrates of the multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter using Corbicula fluminea, Lytechinus pictus, Mytilus californianus, and Mytilus edulis. The multi-xenobiotic resistant transporter (MXR) is a functional homologue of the mammalian multi-drug resistant transporter (MDR), a P-glycoprotein. In aquatic systems, MXR serves as a first line of defense against an array of lipophilic compounds. Musk ketone increased the accumulation of the MXR substrate rhodamine B in L. pictus embryos, and M. californianus gill tissue; initial testing implicated accumulation of rhodamine B in C. fluminea. Musk ketone increased the toxicity of vinblastine-- a MXR substrate that inhibits microtubule formation--in L. pictus, but not in M. edulis embryos. However, musk ketone did not definitely slow the efflux of rhodamine B from L. Pictus and M. californianus suggesting that this chemical is not acting as a classical MXR inhibitor. I conclude that musk ketone is not acting directly on MXR, and must cause accumulation through an alternative, yet to be determined, pathway. Statistical analysis: analysis of variance(ANOVA), and Student-Newman-Keuls test for significant difference, alpha=0.05.","668":"Human activity at Point Pinos, a popular rocky intertidal site in Pacific Grove, CA, was quantified over a period of seven weeks from April 6, 2000 to May 28, 2000. Over 17,000 people were observed over the 7 weeks. Intensity of activity varied greatly among 9 contiguous sites within Pt. Pinos, ranging from 12 to 36 people ha-1 sweep-1 (averaged over the 7 weeks for each site). There was also a high degree of day-to-day variation with daily values ranging from <20 to nearly 700 per sweep, pooled over the entire Point. Of all visitors, only 18% ever entered the rocky intertidal zone itself, with >80% remaining in the parking lots or on the sandy beach areas. Data indicated that collecting, or taking of shells or invertebrates, occurred rarely. Trampling appeared to be the greatest potential impact on sessile species located in the high and mid intertidal zones. A comparison of the abundance of potentially susceptible (i.e. Pelvetia compressa) and non-susceptible (i.e. limpets) sessile species between high-use and low-use Sites indicated that bare space increases at the high-use Sites. The abundance of non-susceptible species did not differ significantly between Sites, whereas the abundance of susceptible species decreased in the high-use Sites. Significant spatial variability between Sites revealed that differences in species abundance between high-use and low-use Sites cannot solely be attributed to trampling; hence, other factors such as sand scour and wave action may have contributed to the heterogeneity.","669":"The purpose of this experiment was to determine if Ca 2+ and nitric oxide (NO), two common intracellular signaling molecules, affect metamorphosis of the tunicate Ascidia ceratodes. The larvae were assessed for competence to metamorphosis using Nile Blue sulfate, which even at 10-7 M significantly increased settlement. Calcium's affect on settlement was tested using Ionomycin, which induced metamorphosis suggesting calcium's involvement in settlement. Nitroprusside, an NO donor, also induced settlement, suggesting NO's involvement in settlement as well.","670":"The purpose of my experiments was to test the behavioral response and capabilities of the cubomedusan Tripedalia cystophora to various visual stimuli. My hypothesis was that the cubomedusae would respond more strongly (be more attracted to) color toward the blue end of the visual spectrum as well as to reflective small objects within the water that mimic their food sources. Lab experiments showed that T. cystophora did indeed favor blue light (440 nanometers, 480 nanometers) over red light (700 nanometers) when a tight cone of light of a given color was placed at a the end of a rectangular tank. Green light was intermediately favored (515 nanometers, 540 nanometers) as was violet light (385) nanometers. Experiments also showed that T. cystophora were attracted to long wave Ultra Violet Light (360 nanometers) but not significantly to short wave Ultra Violet (254). Also, in experiments testing preference for texture of the light cone, T. cystophora favored reflective bodies within the light cone (chemically neutral brine shrimp, small T. Cystophora) over only the light cone. A uniform rising movement was also noticed upon the onset of darkness.","671":"Like other members of its genus, Conus californicus has a highly evolved venom apparatus with which it injects paralyzing venom into its prey through a modified radula tooth. Although much research is being conducted on the venom itself, relatively little is known about the biology behind the snail's ability to inject the venom. The venom duct, radula sac and teeth were characterized in terms of anatomy, physiology and chemistry. The passageway between the venom duct and proboscis is a complex branching structure lined by a unique secretory cell type. Evidence from a combination of all methods used suggests that there are similar active peptides in the teeth as in the duct, leading to the possibility that the teeth are pre-loaded with venom.","672":"Tegula funebralis, the black turban snail, is an intertidal gastropod with a distinctive intertidal size gradient; large snails tend to live in the lower portion of the snail's range and small snails in the upper portion. Many factors have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, including differential larval settlement, juvenile mortality, response to light, and, most commonly, predation pressure. I investigated the potential contribution of thermal stress on size gradient in a study area that has been shown to have very little predation on Tegula. I performed two types of experiments: temperature measurements of gelatin-filled snails and heat shock protein analysis of gill tissue from large and small snails that had been caged in the intertidal. Although my heat shock analysis was inconclusive, temperatures were consistently lower in small snails than in large snails, both in a controlled environment and in the field, a disparity possible caused by differences in the absorptivity of large and small snail shells. Heat shock protein analysis could verify that larger snails experience this increased heat stress. Finally, a vertical size gradient also appears to occur between different intertidal gastropod species, another indication that size-dependent thermal stress could be important in determining intertidal gastropod zonation.","673":"In order to measure organic pollutants and heavy metals in coastal waters, previous studies have directly assayed for these compounds in tissues of bioaccumulators such as Mytilus galloprovincialis. In contrast, this study measured the activity of the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the digestive gland of M. galloprovincialis as a bioindicator of the state of organic pollution at three sites in the San Francisco and Monterey Bays with varying pollutant levels. Glutathione S-transferase activity was measured through the conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to reduced glutathione (GSH) to form CDNB-SH, at a wavelength of 340 nm. The activity data were collected in milliabsorbance units\/min and were normalized by dividing by total tissue wet weight. Activity was highest in M. galloprovincialis from the most polluted site, Moss Landing (0.0573 \u00b1 0.0226 mAbs\/min\/g tissue), intermediate in specimens from the Palo Alto site (0.0327 \u00b1 0.0140 mAbs\/min\/g tissue), and lowest in samples from the least polluted site, Monterey Marina (0.0228 \u00b1 0.0068 mAbs\/min\/g tissue, ANOVA p = 3.8 x 10-6).

Mytilus galloprovincialis was transplanted from polluted water at Moss Landing into pristine seawater and GST activity was measured over 30 days. There was a significant decrease in GST activity with reduced exposure to organic pollutants.","674":"Conus californicus is the only temperate species of a large genus of predatory prosobranch gastropods\u202d. \u202cWe studied their foraging behavior and diurnal patterns of activity in relation to fullness of the gut\u202d. \u202cWe found 29%\u202d \u202cof 59\u202d \u202cC\u202d. \u202ccalifornicus obtained from the field had prey in their gut\u202d. \u202cOf these\u202d, \u202cthe most common prey items were the tube-dwelling polychaetes Sabella crassicornis\u202d \u202cand Diopatra ornata\u202d. \u202cIn the laboratory\u202d, \u202cC\u202d. \u202ccalifornicus digested a full gut of S\u202d. \u202ccrassicornis in 44\u202d \u202cto 60\u202d \u202chours\u202d. \u202cWe also found that C\u202d. \u202ccalifornicus are more active at night than during daylight\u202d. \u202cIn a laboratory experiment\u202d, \u202cC\u202d. \u202ccalifornicus with full guts were significantly less active than unfed individuals for two consecutive nights after feeding\u202d (\u202cP\u202d <.\u202c01\u202d). \u202cDuring the third and fourth nights\u202d, \u202cactivity increased and there were no significant differences between fed and unfed individuals\u202d (\u202cP\u202d >.\u202c44\u202d). \u202cThroughout the experiment\u202d, \u202cthere were never any differences between fed and unfed individuals during daylight hours\u202d (\u202cp\u202d = \u202c0.51\u202d). \u202cThese results suggest that activity of C\u202d. \u202ccalifornicus is influenced strongly by prey consumption\u202d: \u202cimmediately after feeding\u202d, \u202cnocturnal activity decreases significantly\u202d. \u202cAfter an interval adequate for complete digestion\u202d, \u202cnocturnal activity resumes rapidly\u202d.\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c","675":"Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial ascidian that reproduces the entire colony every week through a synchronized asexual budding process. At the end of this seven day cycle, all functional zooids undergo synchronized apoptosis and are resorbed by blastozooids of the new generation. There is evidence that suggests a similar mechanism controls apoptosis in many vertebrates and invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. In mammalian cells, expression of certain genes from the bcl-2 gene family regulates apoptosis, the physiological process that eliminates unwanted cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of bcl-2 in apoptosis of B. schlosseri. This study shows that there are at least seven members of the bcl-2 gene family expressed in B. schlosseri. The sequences of two isolated clones of the bcl-2 gene, called bcl-2 B and bcl-2 B+, show a 40% homology with known vertebrate bcl-2 sequences. These genes exhibit differential expression throughout the asexual life cycle. Bcl-2 B maintains a consistent level of expression throughout the asexual life cycle of the colony while bcl-2 B+ is down regulated after the early stages of the zooid lifespan. The results of this study suggest that the bcl-2 gene family might regulate apoptosis in the asexual life cycle of B. schlosseri as well.","676":"Pachygrapsis crassipes, the lined purple shore crab, is equipped with extremely sensitive sensory hairs on its walking legs.

This study examined the vibratory sensitivity of these tactile sensors in order to quantify the frequency range to which they respond, as well as their absolute level of sensitivity. Electrophysiological methods were used to determine the sensors' threshold to impulse-like stimuli. Neuronal responses were then tested over a wide range of frequencies and intensities to more completely quantify the sensitivity range.","677":"Understanding source-sink dynamics is critical to successful design of marine reserves. Determining what conditions optimize the production and quality of larvae is a crucial step in identifying optimal source habitat. Water temperature may be an important factor to consider since it influences reproduction and growth in many marine species. During spring upwelling, water temperatures within Monterey Bay, California are generally 2\u00ba to 3\u00ba C warmer than at nearby open coast sites. Egg size and allocation to reproduction (reproductive effort) were measured in the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula collected from 3 populations within Monterey Bay and 3 open coast populations outside of the bay. Additional collections were made in Southern California and Oregon to test for a latitudinal gradient in embryo size. Egg size did not vary between Southern California and Oregon barnacles. Within Central California, however, eggs were roughly 10% larger at the colder open coast sites than within Monterey Bay. Differences in reproductive effort were not correlated with habitat type (bay vs. open coast); rather, the three northernmost sites had lower reproductive effort than the three southernmost sites. Further study quantifying food availability and barnacle growth rates are needed. However, this study suggests that substantial variation may exist in the quantity and quality of barnacle larvae produced by closely spaced sites. Such variation should be considered when siting marine reserves.","678":"Nitric oxide (NO) is an unconventional neurotransmitter. It is not stored in vesicles and released by exocytosis. Rather, it is produced from arginine by the activation of a calcium\/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO acts as an orthograde neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, which means that it is released by pre-synaptic cells and affects post-synaptic cells. This unusual molecule stimulates soluble guanylyl cylcase and increases intracellular levels of cGMP in the post-synaptic cell. I wondered if an exogenous NO donor like sodium nitroprusside would result in post-synaptic membrane depolarization and increased input resistance in cells thought to receive this type of input. Using microelectrode techniques, I measured resting potentials and action potentials in the MCC (metacerebral cell) in the cerebral ganglion of Aplysia californica. I found that sodium nitroprusside caused a subthreshold membrane depolarization and increase in input resistance. The literature suggests that these effects may be the result of NO donors acting on potassium channels in the post-synaptic membrane. These experiments support the idea that NO acts as a transmitter or as a neuromodulator to influence the excitability of post-synaptic neurons in Aplysia\u270e","679":"The gastropod mollusc Strombus luhuanus, prey to some Conus snails, exhibits a morphologically unique extendable foot utilized for fast escape response. The pedal ganglion of specimens was identified using in situ stimulation of radiating axon bundles and observing pedal response. Once the two lobes were removed, neurons were dissociated using glass teasing needles and studied under whole-cell patch clamp. Outward potassium currents were observed to have complex activation kinetics and biphasic inactivation. These kinetics were characterized and used to develop a pre-pulse protocol for current separation. Two distinct voltage-gated potassium currents were identified and isolated using this pre-pulse procedure. The fast activating and inactivation current resembled a classic A-current and could reach peak current within 2 milliseconds after pulse initiation for large depolarizations, and inactivated completely in about 30 ms. The second component of potassium current resembled a delayed rectifier and exhibited slow and incomplete inactivation, with peak current occurring within 5 or 6 milliseconds for large depolarizations and partial inactivation over the much longer period of about 150 milliseconds. The kinetic properties of each individual current were analyzed and described and a model based on Hodgkin-Huxley was used to compute conductance time course as a function of voltage.","680":"Cone snails are predatory marine gastropods of the genus Conus which proliferated to over 500 species world wide largely through the use of novel peptide toxins (conotoxins) that are injected into prey items through a harpooning apparatus. Conotoxins have evolved for maximal effect on prey species hunted by each cone snail species (Duda and Palumbi 1999). All cone snail venoms examined thus far contain peptides that act with great specificity on a variety of channels including K+, Na+, Ca2+, and ACh receptors (Olivera et al. 1999). Further studies have shown that IK in these cells was found to be insensitive to externally applied S-nitrosodithiothreitol (SNDTT), a compound that shows a high degree of specificity for block of the Kv1 subfamily (Brock, Mathes, and Gilly, 1997). Additionally, the venom-sensitive current was found to overlap with that blocked by externally applied tetraethylammonium (TEA), which has been shown to selectively inhibit delayed rectifier (DR) IK in frog SG neurons (Spruce et al., 1987 and Klemic, et al., 1998).","681":"Traditional ecological models developed in rocky intertidal systems state that species ranges are determined primarily by physical stress in upper tidal zones and biotic interactions in lower tidal zones. Studies of the barnacles Balanus and Chthamalus show that smaller chthamaloids are able to persist in a larger range of habitats than balanoids because of their greater tolerance to physical stress and lower susceptibility to predation. I tested this model on the barnacles Balanus glandula and Chthamalus spp. at two sites in Monterey Bay which differed in wave exposure and abundance of the common predatory snail, Nucella emarginata. I ran lab experiments to determine prey preferences of N. emarginata, and then measured densities of both species of barnacles and of the whelk along transects in the field. B. glandula and Chthamalus spp. distributions were positively correlated, indicating that competition between the two species did not play an important role in determining distribution. Nested ANOVA's of barnacle densities revealed significant differences between sites and among replicate transects within each site for both species. Although whelks were abundant in the exposed site, they did not play a major role in determining barnacle abundance. Lab experiments showed that Nucella emarginata had a strong preference for B. glandula over Chthamalus spp. As this difference did not manifest itself in differential distributions in the field, I conclude that factors other than whelk predation alone regulate the distribution of these species. A strong recruitment event in spring 2001 of B. glandula enabled me to compare distributions of B. glandula adults and recruits. No strong difference was detected. The very high variance in barnacle density in both sites may indicate that barnacle distributions in Monterey Bay are regulated by multiple complex factors. Further research is needed to understand these interactions.","682":"Crude homogenates of the algae Fucus vesiculosus contain a factor(s) capable of inhibiting the fertilization of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin) eggs. Previous studies indicated that this effect might have been due to the polysaccharide fucoidan. I here examined the effect of the homogenate at a molecular, cellular and ecological level. Inhibitory activity was present in seawater homogenates of the algae at a concentration of approximately 2 mg fresh weight\/ml. The inhibitory factor was heat stable and molecular sieve centrifuge filtration showed the active fraction had a molecular weight above 10,000. Comparison of the >10,000 MW fraction with fucoidan indicates that the inhibitor in the homogenate is not fucoidan or is not fuciodan alone. Sperm binding experiments showed that the factor(s) prevents sperm from penetrating the jelly layer of the eggs and possibly from penetrating the vitelline layer. This suggests that the factor(s) inhibit a sperm enzyme that allows sperm to penetrate the jelly layer and perhaps the vitelline layer. Studies assessing whether intact F. vesiculosus might leak the inhibitory factor into the surrounding seawater\u2014as in a tide pool\u2014and thereby affect fertilization were inconclusive. Characterization of this potent inhibitor could provide new insights into the sperm-egg interactions leading to fertilization.","683":"In this study I examined metabolic rates of Mytilus californianus located at the upper and lower extremes of the Mytilus distribution zone in an exposed rocky intertidal area at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA. Mussels high in the zone spend less time exposed to normoxic conditions as a result of longer emersion periods. They also experience greater temperature fluctuations. Such abiotic stresses were expected to make metabolic rates among high and low mussels different. Respiration (O2 consumption) and malate dehydrogenase activities of gill tissue were used as indicators of metabolism. The design of this experiment led to mussel acclimation over a period of 25 days. When plotted against time, enzyme activities of low mussels showed a significant (p = 0.048) decrease in activity. Additionally, a significant (p = 0.014) decrease was observed in O2 consumption of high mussels. The unexpectedly rapid physiological plasticity shown by M. californianus resulted in small sample sizes (enzyme n = 10, respiration n = 4) of freshly collected individuals, which may have contributed to the non-significant differences seen in high and low mussel MDH activities (p = 0.059) and respiration rates (p = 0.74). It was also concluded from this experiment that MDH activity is not a good predictor of respiration rate, possibly due to its role in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.","684":"Previous studies of the woolly sculpin\u202d, \u202cClinocottus analis, have revealed homing behavior and site fidelity in this wide-ranging intertidal fish.

Based on their ability to function at such different temperatures, their nervous systems must compensate to accommodate the environmental changes, either in order to keep behavior the same or to change the animal's behavior in favor of homeostasis. To look at how a nervous system behaves at different temperatures, isolated ganglia from the yellow dorid nudibranch, Doriopsilla albopunctata, were exposed to temperature ranges simulating those of the intertidal zone (10 to 25 degrees Celsius). Single electrode intracellular recordings were taken to study the behavior of individual neurons. Variation in spontaneous activity, firing frequency, utilization time and synaptic potentials revealed individualistic, non-uniform responses to temperature on the neural level. The data suggest that neurons in Doriopsilla albopunctata are not individually temperature compensated, and therefore temperature compensation does not happen on the neuronal level. Nor do the data show that all nerve cells respond to temperature the same way. Instead these results suggest that the overall maintenance of neural function across a temperature gradient arises from properties of the system as a whole rather than individual neurons.","687":"This paper examines kinetic properties of Na+ channels in Strombus luhanus, a gastropod notable for its rapid backward jumping escape response. Previous comparative studies on cephalopod and gastropod Na+ channels indicate that taxonomic differences exist in the voltage-dependencies of activation and inactivation: cephalopod channels are fast across a broad range of voltages, whereas gastropod channels are much slower at negative voltages than they are at very positive voltages. The voltage-independence of cephalopod Na+ channel kinetics is hypothesized to be important in mediating fast escape and swimming behavior. Analysis of kinetic parameters of Strombus sodium currents was performed in order to ascertain whether the voltage-dependence of their activation and inactivation rates deviate from those of slower gastropods and resemble those of cephalopods. It was found that as in cephalopods, activation rates in Strombus Na+ channels display little voltage-dependence. Similar to other gastropods, however, inactivation rates in Strombus Na+ channels are quite voltage-dependent.","688":"The opening and closing of ion channels within the membrane of a neuron allows for the flow of specific ions into and out of a cell. The flow of ions through membrane channels creates current and this changes the voltage across the cell membrane. These changes in voltage create the action potentials responsible for the propagation of neural signals. If the number of ion channels changes or the kinetics of individual channels change, the currents through the membrane will be altered and hence change the excitability the cell. Here I report changes in potassium conductance within the neurons of Doriopsilla albopunctata after treatment and recovery from a thirty-minute heat shock at 30\u00b0 C. By using a voltage clamp, currents of individual cells were characterized. The cells were heat shocked and characterized again using the same stimulation regime. Significant increases in potassium conductance were observed within many, although not all, cells. In such cases, a novel current was found to be responsible for the change in potassium conductance. I conclude that heat shock affects either the expression of channels in the cell membrane or the kinetics of pre-existing ion channels, but only in some neurons. What cellular mechanism was responsible for this change and what specifically it changes, remains to be seen.","689":"I quantified the spatial distribution\u202d, \u202cphysiological tolerances\u202d, \u202cand respiration rates of larvae of the intertidal fly\u202d, \u202cOedoparena glauca. O. glauca larvae consume the barnacle, Balanus glandula, and use the shell for protection and pupation. The percent of barnacles infested with larvae and pupae was greatest in a high-intertidal crevice (29%), moderate on upper north-facing intertidal walls (~3%), and zero at lower tidal heights and on south-facing walls. Thermal stress, high salinity, and submergence are physiological stresses imposed on the larvae and pupae due to life in the intertidal zone. In laboratory tests of thermal tolerance, all larvae died following 3 hours of exposure to 39 degrees C, but tolerated temperatures less than or equal to 38 degrees C. Pupae appeared more sensitive to thermal stress, with 0% eclosion by pupae treated at 35 degrees C, 38 degrees C, and 41 degrees C for four hours. Intertidal datalogger records and field measurements of internal B. glandula temperatures exceeded 36 degrees C, near the thermal limit of O. glauca larvae. In addition to this thermal stress, during periods of aerial exposure, B. glandula was significantly more saline in vivo than the surrounding seawater, perhaps due to evaporative cooling by the barnacle. In tests of submergence tolerance, larvae survived 8 days of submergence in filtered seawater held at 13 degrees C, but all died after 10 days. The pupae were apparently more sensitive to submergence; 40% of pupae submerged for two hours enclosed within 16 days, whereas there was only 12.5% eclosion of pupae submerged for 24 hours. The larvae were observed not to respire during six hours of submergence. However, the larvae respired at a rate of 0.4317 \u00b5mol O2\/hr\/g, over four days of submergence. This study illustrates that O. glauca larvae are hardy and capable of tolerating thermal stress and submergence. In contrast, the pupae may be more sensitive to these environmental conditions, perhaps restricting their geographical distribution .\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c","690":"The snail\u202d \u202cCalliostoma canaliculatum secretes a yellow mucous ('Yellow Stuff' or YS) in response to attack from predatory starfish Pisaster giganteus and Pycnopodia helianthoides. Previous studies have shown that YS inhibits the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, and the active component responsible for this action is proposed to be a serotonin dimer derivative, 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine. Because serotonin is a crucial neurotransmitter in invertebrates, components of YS may also have an effect on the behaviour of neural networks where serotonin plays a role. Several lines of experiments were carried out to identify any possible relationships between the actions of these two compounds. Behavioural studies on the brittle star Ophiopteris papillosa, showed a similar response to both these compounds \u2013 immediate arm retraction. Results from these experiments established a biologically relevant concentration of YS for further testing. Control experiments carried out in Shaker potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that at this concentration, YS did not lead to a slowing of K-current activation. Additional experiments were performed using the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. B cells in this ganglia contain serotonin receptors and many of the cells and synaptic connections are modulated by serotonin. Single electrode recordings from B cells after application of serotonin demonstrated a marked increase in spontaneous activity (action potentials and post-synaptic potentials). Subsequent application of YS significantly decreased this activity, and further application of serotonin after YS had been washed away, renewed activity. This suggests that in the neural circuits involved in stimulation by serotonin, YS may function as an antagonist, and therefore Yellow Stuff may be acting in invertebrates via neuromodulatory pathways that involve serotonin.\u202c\u202c\u202c","691":"The evolution of high metabolism has occurred in numerous lineages. Mammals, birds, tuna and squid all maintain high metabolic rates. Elevated metabolic rates demand high cardiac output. How the heart evolves the cellular machinery to deliver a high cardiac output remains unexplored. Tunas are exceptional amongst bony fishes in being endothermic. They maintain a high metabolic rate over a wide range of ambient temperatures. Bluefin tuna have been recorded to swim in ambient temperatures as low of 2.8\u00b0 C. In cold waters, tuna maintain high temperatures in their muscles through a highly vascularized countercurrent heat exchange system. However, their heart temperatures are exposed to ambient temperatures. Tuna hearts deliver high cardiac outputs, high frequency contractions, and high power outputs in a wide range of temperatures. This project examined the mechanisms that allow tuna to produce their high cardiac outputs at the cellular level. In this project I investigated the importance of increased dependence on calcium cycling in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in tuna hearts. The presence of calcium ATPase and the SR calcium release channel were examined using biochemical purification of the SR membrane. The proteins are required to release and take up calcium from the cytoplasm into the SR during contraction and relaxation of the heart. SR protein was purified in wild yellowfin and bluefin tuna hearts. The SR preparation was separated on 7.5% and 3-12% gradient SDS gels. The Serca 2 pump was visualized using a Comassie blue stain of the gels and an antibody specific to Serca 2 on Western blots. Both gels and blots indicate that yellowfin and bluefin atria and ventricles have the calcium ATPase and ryanodine receptors. Densitometry using NIH Image suggests higher levels of Serca 2 in the atria than ventricles in both tuna. A functional assay of calcium uptake was performed on SR vesicles using a calcium-sensitive dye, Fura 2, in a spectroflourophotometer. Preliminary results indicate similar rates of SR calcium uptake between yellowfin and bluefin tuna and between tuna atria and ventricles. The detection of SR in tuna hearts provides insight into the mechanism by which tuna maintain high cardiac outputs in a wide range of ambient temperatures.","692":"Mytilus californianus dominates the rocky mid-intertidal zone along much of the West Coast of North America from Alaska to Baja California. Thus, it has important effects on community structure. Previous work has failed to identify genetic differences among populations along this latitudinal gradient. However, some differences in morphology have been described. A preliminary study showed that mussels from Central Oregon grew significantly faster than those from Central California when transplanted to sites in either state. My study investigated physiological differences in populations of M. californianus from Oregon and California. In February, mussels were transplanted to California from Oregon and California. In May, additional mussels were freshly collected from the original populations. Gill respiration rates and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity were examined to compare metabolic rates of individuals in these populations, and determine if differences were intrinsic or transitory effects of acclimation.","693":"Marine Conus snails produce a wide variety of neurotoxins (\"conotoxins\") that specifically bind to different ion channels and neuronal receptors. Much research has revolved around the physiological effects of the conotoxins without focus on how these snails produce their venom. For example, the temperate snail Conus californicus produces a novel conotoxin that targets voltage-sensitive sodium channels in cephalopod, but not gastropod neurons. The predicted molecular weight from the cDNA sequence encoding this peptide is 4680 Da. Numerous dense granules appear in the venom duct of Conus californicus, where venom production occurs. In an attempt to isolate the granules, as a first step towards biochemical characterization, crude venom was run on a Ficoll-sucrose gradient. Inspection of these granules with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of dense granules of approximately 2-6 \u00b5m in diameter. Electrophoresis of the SDS solubilized granules revealed a prominent 5 kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide tricine gels that matches a band in \"milked\" venom and duct venom. This 5 kDa granule peptide was not solubilized by nonionic detergent (NP40) suggesting that it is packed within a tightly associated granule complex. Observation with light microscopy indicated that application of heat disintegrated the granules and released soluble, bio-active peptide into the medium. Preliminary whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of disassociated cells from the stellate ganglion of Sepia officinalis showed that the granule contents block voltage-gated sodium channels. In conclusion, it appears that these dense granules contain a peptide resembling mature milked venom peptide in both mass and function.","694":"Phospholipase activity is known to be present in the venoms of many venomous animals, including snakes, bees, and one Conus species. Whole duct venom was extracted from several specimens of Conus californicus, dissolved in seawater, and centrifuged. The supernatant fraction was observed to possess robust cytolytic activity. The biochemical basis of this activity was explored using two enzymatic assays. First, proteolytic activity of the venom supernatant towards casein, a universal protease substrate, was assayed spectrophotometrically. Following incubation with the venom supernatant, unreacted casein was precipitated and activity assayed by measuring any increase in absorbance of the reaction mixture as a result of digested casein in solution. The venom showed no detectable caseinase activity. Second, phospholipase activity of the venom supernatant toward L,a-phosphatidyl choline was assayed. Activity was measured spectrophotometrically, based on an absorbance change of the pH indicator phenol red due to the liberation of free fatty acids. Significant phospholipase activity was detected. This activity increased with the addition of calcium, suggesting that the responsible enzyme is calcium-dependent. Activity was lost subsequent to heating, suggesting that the responsible enzyme was denatured.","695":"The barnacle\u202d \u202cTetraclita squamosa rubescens exhibits a high degree of variation in shell morphology. Research on other barnacle species suggests that a variety of factors, particularly whelk predation and temperature stress may influence the nature of this morphological variation. By sampling T. squamosa rubescens in several sites in Monterey and Pacific Grove, California, we established that barnacle morphology varies significantly with respect to location and the vertical orientation of the substrate. One of the major aspects that differed between locations is whelk predation and the vertical orientation of the barnacles' substrate. Barnacles are taller on vertical substrate, and barnacles in areas of high whelk predation have more enclosed, recessed opercular plates. By exposing whelks to barnacles with artificially exposed opercular plates in caged experimental treatments, we found that the whelks preferentially prey on barnacles with exposed opercular plates. Our predation field experiment corroborates the field sampling data insofar as the exposure of the opercular plates decreases with increased whelk abundance, and decreased exposure of the opercular plates significantly decreases the risk of whelk predation. Moreover, by measuring the heat flux through barnacles with different shapes, we ascertained a significant difference in the temperature budgets of taller, narrower barnacles versus barnacles with a shorter, broader shape. It appears that barnacles with tall, narrow shells shed heat to the air more rapidly. These observations and experiments support the hypothesis that the shell morphology of the Tetraclita barnacle has significant effects on its susceptibility to predation and temperature change.\u202c\u202c\u202c","696":"The American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), Western Gull (Larus occidentalis), and American Black Oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani) are year-round residents in and near the rocky intertidal ecosystem of Pacific Grove, California. All three species are large mobile predators that serve important roles in structuring the rocky intertidal community. Due to the high abundance of human visitors along the Monterey Bay coastline, interaction between these birds and humans is inevitable. This study examined the effects of human presence on the spatial distribution and behavioral time budgeting of the aforementioned species. I found that humans were more abundant on weekends than weekdays, but no corresponding differences in abundance existed for birds. No significant correlation between bird location or behavioral time budget and human presence could be determined for any of the three species. When approached experimentally, resting birds of each species tended to take off at a farther distance from humans (lower tolerance) than did foraging birds, but these trends were not significant. Also, once disturbed, crows flew a significantly shorter distance than gulls and oystercatchers. These findings suggest that the abundance, behavior and location of these three species are not heavily influenced by human presence, but when disturbed the energetic cost to the bird may vary with species and behavior.","697":"Diopatra ornata is a tube-dwelling polychaete commonly found in sandy subtidal regions from Mexico to California. Despite their abundance, little information has been published about D. ornata. This study examined tube construction, locomotion, feeding habits, and activity patterns of D. ornata, and its ability to regenerate lost or damaged regions of its body. D. ornata construct elaborate sand and mucus tube caps that are anchored in the sand and arch over with the aperture ~1 cm above the sand and facing downward. Worms attach pieces of shell and drift kelp to the tube cap and can add on as much as 6 cm of new tube in one day. The portion of the tube that extends down into the substratum is more fragile and runs ~ horizontally at a depth of ~10 cm below the surface of the sand. The worms move up and down inside their tubes using parapodia and can turn around completely inside it. They can extend their bodies up to approximately 8 cm from the aperture of the their tube to retrieve food or tube building material, but can quickly withdraw by sudden muscle contraction. They were never observed to leave their tubes completely. When foraging, D. ornata sit at the aperture of their tube cap and undulate their 5 cephalic cirri rapidly. They appear to sense the presence of food nearby using chemoreception or touch. Time lapse video showed that the worms have distinct day-night patterns of activity, with feeding or working on the buried portion of their tubes as the primary diurnal activity, and repair or addition to the tube cap at night. Regeneration of a head appears to require anterior segments with gills; more posterior sections of the body died and deteriorated within 2 days. Sections maintained in natural or artificial tubes (plastic straws) appeared to survive longer, but did not show any signs of regeneration in 22 days. Further study is needed to more fully understand some of these behaviors and examine other behaviors, such as their reproduction.","698":"Different distributions of ridged and smooth morphologies of Nucella emarginata are found at wave-exposed and protected sites at China Point in Monterey Bay. A greater number of the ridged morphology was found at the protected site and the smooth at the exposed. Variation in drag coefficients, adhesive force, and crushing force between shell morphologies do not appear to dictate this difference in distribution, although adhesive force is marginally greater in wave exposed whelks. Predation on tethered whelks is greater in the ridged morphology in general than the smooth. However, whelks were eaten more quickly at the protected site, suggesting that wave action\u2019s effect on predators may play a role in the distribution of the two morphologies. In a laboratory experiment, crabs showed no preference between ridged or smooth N. emarginata, with a slight preference for exposed whelks. After 27 days of growth, it was unclear whether differences in shell morphology were present among juveniles hatched from the exposed site.","699":"The jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, exhibits chromatophore-effected flashing behavior at frequencies of about 3 Hz. In order to characterize this behavior quantitatively and to make it possible to speculate as to its function, videos of D. gigas in its natural environment were taken and analyzed. There is great variability in the consistency of flashing rates among individuals: some stay relatively stable while others fluctuate widely in short spans of time. Videos of two squid encountering one another suggested that squid adjust to their conspecifics' flashing patterns in complex ways. A greater corpus of data will be necessary before specific hypotheses about the function of D. gigas' flashing behavior can be formulated.","700":"Previous reports on the behavior of Macclintockia scabra have implied that the intertidal limpet moves every time it is wetted by the incoming tide. In a three-week study on the potential effects of location, splash and light level on limpet movement, frequency of movement (number of instances individual limpet moved divided by the number of instances limpet was wet \u2013 averaged over all observed limpets) was calculated to be 12%. This is based on 2660 field observations on seventy-nine limpets, dispersed among three sites, differing in degree of wave exposure. I also made 600 observations on twenty-five limpets that had established home scars on rocks transported to the laboratory. Frequency of movement in the lab was 15%. A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on frequency of movement, with degree of splash and field site as the two factors. Data from during the day and at night had to be analyzed separately because all possible combinations of \"splash\", \"site\" and \"light level\" did not occur during my field study. Frequency of movement did not differ significantly among sites. No movement was observed at low tide in either the lab or field. An increased frequency of movement was found to accompany a corresponding increase in splash level, both at night and during the day. However, lab results showed a decreased frequency of movement when limpets were submerged rather than sprinkled by a spray bar. A significantly greater amount of movement (25%) was seen at night than during the day (7%) \u2013 a finding that could be due to the higher nighttime tidal heights. Lab results showed no significant difference in day and night movement frequency. In a separate experiment, limpets were exposed to an artificial high tide, during a normally low tidal period. The limpets responded by producing a significantly lower-than-normal frequency of movement (8%). 10\/15 tidal simulations resulted in a movement frequency of zero. My findings suggest that Macclintockia scabra may use a combination of splash level, light, and other as yet identified \"tidal-timing\" cues to induce movement. Location appears to play a less significant role.","701":"Many poikilotherms exhibit adaptive changes in cellular membrane fluidity (homeoviscous adaptation) to counter potentially disruptive effects of thermal variation in their environments. The process of homeoviscous adaptation was studied in an intertidal snail, Littorina keenae, which encounters wide variation in body temperature due to differences in microhabitat conditions and the effects of tidal rhythms. This study investigated the effects of thermal variation arising from microhabitat differences between two geographic sites and from tidal cycle effects within a single site on membrane fluidity. L. keenae, a species widespread along the North American Pacific Coast, was studied at two sites on Cabrillo Point at Hopkins Marine Station in Central California, one being wind and wave exposed (exposed site), the other relatively protected by its cove-like orientation (protected site). Protected site individuals exhibited body temperature fluctuations as great as 20\u00b0C within a six-hour period (10 to 30\u00b0C), whereas the exposed population exhibited only a 10\u00b0C range in the most extreme case (10 to 20\u00b0C). Fluidities of membranes of gill and mantle tissue were quantified by measuring fluorescence anisotropy using the membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). Samples from the exposed site population collected prior to and following midday low tide exhibited no differences in membrane viscosity. However, in one instance exposed individuals collected at the same time showed two distinct levels of membrane fluidity, suggesting disparate thermal histories. In addition, comparisons with previously published data on membrane fluidity for other species may indicate that L. keenae is compensating toward its upper thermal range.","702":"Atrazine, a s-triazine herbicide, is the most widely used herbicide in the U.S. and is also used in over 80 countries. It is of concern since after spring rains and by leeching processes, atrazine and its breakdown products (considered equally as toxic) enter water supplies, streams, and other major bodies of water. It reaches levels in community water systems up to 89 ppb, in river basins up to 131 ppb, in drinking water up to 12 ppb, and even in rainfall up to 40 ppb. Atrazine alters neuroendocrine function, causes mammary tumors in rats, and a recent study showed demasculation and hermaphroditism in frogs at concentrations as low as 1 ppb. The high levels of atrazine in aquatic environments due to agricultural runoff, coupled with the significant effects of atrazine on the MXR mechanism raises concern over the health of other marine organisms. Atrazine's inhibition of the MXR substrate potentially could allow other toxic or carcinogenic agents to enter cells and adversely affect the health of marine communities.","703":"Similar to other members of its genus, Conus striatus has a highly evolved venom apparatus that serves to inject paralyzing venom into its prey through a hollow, tubular radular tooth. Although much research is currently being conducted on the properties of the venom itself, little investigation has been done to elucidate the biomechanics behind the snail\u2019s ability to inject its venom. Studies were carried out with individual radular teeth that defined the pressure-flow characteristics in order to estimate the pressure used by a snail to eject venom during prey capture. Pressure and flow were directly proportional over the range of investigated pressures (up to 4 cm Hg) and flow rates (up to 2 \u00b5l s-1). Behavioral observations of prey capture were carried out with C. catus, a closely related species that employs similar toxins. Video data revealed the approximate duration of venom injection to be about 100 ms. The duration of venom injection by C. striatus is probably similar, and the volume of ejected venom in this species can be 20 \u00b5l or more based on \u2018milking\u2019 trials. Data suggest that the pressure necessary to carry out such an injection must range from 2-4 atm.","704":"Because zebrafish continue to grow throughout their adult life, they are constantly generating and differentiating new neural tissue. The periventricular zone (PVZ) of the optic tectum, given its generalized, undifferentiated cell morphology, is a possible source of neural precursor cells whose migration into the tectum and differentiation into several different neural fates may be the source of tectal growth. GFP lipofection of brain cross-slices indicated that at least some of these cells are dividing much of the time. We developed a novel procedure for the isolation of PVC cells and demonstrated growth of neurospheres in culture from these progenitors when driven under various growth factors (Insulin, IGF, Retinoic acid, bFGF). Additionally, preliminary antibody staining suggests that at least a subset of these PVC cells express the Notch 1 receptor in vivo, suggesting the possibility of using this receptor as a specific marker for neural progenitor cells.","705":"The brain of the zebrafish Danio rerio is known to contain undifferentiated neural stem cells which continue to divide throughout the life of the organism. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I), nerve growth factor (NGF) and fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were investigated for their ability to modulate neural progenitor cell proliferation in organotypic slice cultures of the adult zebrafish brain. A monoclonal antibody to 5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (BrdU) permitted visualization of those cells that incorporated the nucleotide into DNA during S phase of mitosis. IGF I significantly stimulated neural progenitor cell proliferation across all brain regions investigated. bFGF significantly stimulated mitogenic activity in the dorsomedial optic tectum, torus longitudinalus, and thalamic nucleii, but inhibited cell proliferation in the periventricular hypothalamus. NGF did not stimulate cell proliferation in any of the brain regions tested. The anatomical locations of high proliferative cell density were investigated in vivo by exposing adult zebrafish to BrdU in the ambient water for 24 hours. High densities of dividing cells were found in the outer surface of the optic tectum, the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum, the torus longitudinalus, the thalamic nucleii, the periventricular hypothalamus, the outer surface of the forebrain, and throughout the cerebellum. These findings shed light on the importance of cell division as a mechanism of central nervous system plasticity in adult teleost fishes and reveal the mitogenic effects of IGF I and bFGF in the growth of new neural tissue.","706":"Marine ecologists have traditionally used wave exposure to divide the intertidal zone into communities (Ricketts and Calvin 1985). This project used species abundance data from a horizontal transect at Hopkins Marine Station, combined with physical data about these sites to study horizontal variation in community structure. Cluster analysis upholds traditional ecological descriptions of population structure, in that clusters of species can be attributed to areas of certain wave exposure. However, regression analysis reveals that some species commonly found together had different physical parameters driving their distribution. For example, Lottia giagantea is positively correlated with wave force, but shows no correlation with temperature, azimuth and altitude angles, or the presence of crevices in the rocks. L. giagantea\u2019s clustermate and prey, Hidenbrandia spp., has a negative correlation with altitude angle, but no correlation with wave force, azimuth angle, temperature, or presence of crevices. A smooth horizontal gradient of species does not exist at Hopkins Marine Station. The complex shape of the shoreline causes physical parameters at each site to be uncorrelated with those at neighboring sites and as a result, the horizontal distribution of species at HMS is patchy.","707":"Potential for gene flow in marine environments is often much higher than what is actually observed, due to various barriers to dispersal. Understanding the divisions between populations of organisms is important to fishery regulations and designing effective marine reserves. Tegula funebralis have a pelagic larval phase, lasting 5-14 days, giving them a moderate potential for dispersal. Samples ranging from Oregon to Santa Barbara were collected from seven geographic locations. A 700 base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was sequenced for an average of 9 individuals from each location. Comparing these sequences, there is no clear overall population structure, although there seem to be some slight patterns corresponding to geographic location. In particular, snails from Oregon are more similar to each other and are more different from snails from other populations, suggesting a lower level of dispersal between T. funebralis from Oregon and the more southern locations. These smaller signals could not be shown to be significant with the current sample sizes, using FST values or chi-squared tests, and had p values of between 0.07 and 0.10. Overall, there appears to be a fairly high level of gene flow across the range studied, which makes it unlikely that there are major barriers to dispersal in this range. However, there may be subtle population structure in T. funebralis along the west coast of North America that will emerge when larger sample sizes from each location are used, a larger portion of the gene is sequenced, and populations further to the north and south are sampled.","708":"I studied the effects of temperature stress associated with sun-exposure on feeding behavior in the carnivorous intertidal whelk, Nucella emarginata. Seventy individual whelks were marked and observed at each day-time low tide over a 3 week period at 2 wave protected sites at Hopkins Marine Station. Temperatures ranged from <15\u00ba C on cold, overcast days to >30\u00ba C on calm, sunny days. Temperatures of sun-exposed regions of each site averaged 7.5\u00ba C warmer than sun-protected regions, with the greatest differences on the warmest days. Most larger prey of N. emarginata (Balanus glandula and Mytilus californianus) were more abundant is sun-exposed regions while smaller prey species (Chthamalus spp.) were more abundant is sun-protected areas. Proportions of marked whelks that were feeding varied widely between 5 and 68% on days when exposed temperature was below 28\u00ba C. Above 28\u00ba C, however, percent feeding never exceeded 10% and declined as temperatures rose higher. Whelks that remained feeding in sun exposed areas at the higher temperatures fed predominately on larger, more valuable prey that can take several days to drill and consume, thus experiencing greater potential thermal stress. Whelks transplanted to a nearby site traveled farther than control whelks and sought appropriate shelter before the next low tide (avg. temp = 31.2\u00ba C). They remained more sedentary than controls for the week following transplant, after which they resumed foraging similar to the controls. These results suggest that N. emarginata is conservative in its response to high temperatures during low tide. The response does, however, limit the time available for feeding on larger prey. Consistently warmer temperatures could serve to shift the preferred prey species.","709":"The zebrafish Danio rerio is very useful for the study of cell proliferation in the brain, not only because it has been entirely genetically sequenced, but also because teleosts have remarkable abilities to regenerate parts of their central nervous system after injury. In adult zebrafish, neurogenesis has been documented predominantly in the cerebellum, and in ventricular zones, especially in the telencephalic ventricle in the forebrain. Neurogenesis in the ventricular zones implies that the cells are turning over and remaining progenitor cells; however this study examines whether these cells are differentiating. Discovering a path of differentiation would lend insight into the regulation of regeneration. This study focuses on possible migration of progenitor cells from the periventricular zone to the optic tectum in zebrafish embryos as they develop, using BrdU to label dividing cells and confocal microscopy to image these cells. The results reveal a smattering of nuclei throughout the optic tectum and encephalon, suggesting migration outward from ventricular areas.","710":"The cryptic gastropod species Nucella emarginata and Nucella ostrina are distributed along the northeastern Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja, California. N. emarginata is found primarily in the south and N. ostrina is found primarily in the north, with their ranges overlapping in central California. Snails (7 \u2013 34 individuals) from four locations in the overlap zone were collected and their population structures were studied using an approximately 500 bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Contrary to what might be expected, analysis showed snails from the southern locations of Soberanes Point and San Luis Obispo are both N. ostrina (the northern species), while snails from the northern locations at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove and Point Joe are both N. emarginata. Although populations in each location are fairly homogenous, small amounts of variation do exist within each population (i.e. some polymorphisms are present). Of particular note is the variation that exists between snails collected from a wave exposed area at Hopkins Marine Station and snails in a wave protected area on the other side of the same point. Despite this intra-population variation, each location forms a genetically distinct group. Further sampling in central California will give more insight into the distribution of Nucella over short geographical distances and will hopefully elucidate more of these species\u2019 evolutionary histories, as well as possibly helping to determine what factors are important in Nucella distribution.","711":"In this study, I examined predation by two species of whelk on bay mussels (Mytilis trossulus) to determine whether a northern-occurring species (Nucella ostrina) and a southern-occurring species (Nucella emarginata) differed in thermal dependence of feeding and in absolute feeding rate. Each species was held in three temperature treatments: 21oC, 14-16oC (ambient), and 10.5oC for 28 days. Feeding by both species displayed classical physiological responses to temperature (Q10 = 2) for the first 14 days. By the twenty-first day, when satiation seemed to occur, Q10 values increased to 4.49 and 5.35 for N. emarginata and N. ostrina, respectively. In particular, both species at 10oC demonstrated considerably reduced feeding rates upon satiation. This suggests that metabolic costs were much lower at 10oC and, therefore, the animals required less energy input after satiation. While N. ostrina\u2019s Q10 value declined to 1.67 after an additional 7 days, N. emarginata\u2019s Q10 value declined to 3.40. Across all temperatures, N. emarginata usually had higher feeding rates for the first 14 days, but, after 21 and 28 days, N. ostrina tended to have higher feeding rates. Total consumption rates for the entire experimental period were not significantly different between species at any temperature. These results suggest that, while N. ostrina feeding rates may be lower after a starvation period, N. ostrina is able to maintain similar levels of energy input over the long-term by having a shorter satiation phase. For both species, feeding rates will be discussed with regard to O2 consumption rates.","712":"Intertidal algae are exposed to potentially severe environmental forces on a daily basis. One of the most important of these is the pressure drag generated by crashing waves, the magnitude of which is determined by the interaction of water velocity and an alga\u2019s projected area. This study addresses the effects of increasing drag on the properties of the common intertidal red alga Mastocarpus papillatus. Breaking force of the stipe is positively correlated with drag, indicating morphological and\/or mechanical differences between exposed and protected individuals of this species. Contrary to preliminary work by Carrington (1990), stipe cross-sectional area and material strength are both positively correlated with drag as well as with breaking force, suggesting that an individual blade may be adjusting both of these parameters in response to its mechanical environment. A single blade does not, however, appear to increase both of these factors simultaneously, as stipe cross-sectional area and strength are negatively correlated. Thus I find that M. papillatus may respond to increased drag by either increasing its stipe diameter or its tissue strength but not both together. The range of variation in these two properties, however, remains small when compared to the overall natural variability within the population.","713":"Exposure of teleost fish to predator stress has been shown to elevate plasma cortisol levels. Consequently, we examined the effects of predator stress (albino oscars) on neurogenesis in adult zebrafish. To find out how stress affects adult neurogenesis in the zebrafish, we subjected zebrafish to acute or chronic predator stress and assessed the proliferation of newly born cells in the optic tectum and cerebellum. These regions are known to have measurable rates of cell proliferation. Stereologic analyses of the number of 5-bromo-2\u2019 deoxyuridine (BrdU) \u2013labeled cells revealed that 1 exposure of zebrafish to a predator (acute stress) did not change cell proliferation in the optic tectum or the cerebellum. However, three day repeated predator stress (chronic stress) significantly reduced cell proliferation, by 37% in the optic tectum, while having no significant effect in the cerebellum. A comparison between non-stressed zebrafish optic tectum and cerebellum revealed no significant regional difference in cell proliferation rate. These findings suggest that stressful experiences may down-regulate adult neurogenesis in certain regions of the zebrafish brain, similar to stress induced neurogenesis effects in mammals and birds. This study presents the zebrafish as a unique new model for understanding adult neurogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms.","714":"The periventricular zone (PVZ) of the adult zebrafish central nervous system contains undifferentiated, proliferating cells consistent with the properties of neural progenitors. Past studies suggest that neuronal projections may link the cells of the optic tectum to those in the PVZ. This study explores the pharmacological profile of the cells in the PVZ and examines the hypothesis that cells in the optic tectum may communicate with those in the PVZ through conventional neurotransmitters. Living optic tectum slices were imaged using time-lapse confocal microscopy during application of the excitatory neurotransmitters, glutamate and acetylcholine, and glutamate antagonists. The application of glutamate induced intracellular calcium changes in the cells of the PVZ. The glutamate antagonist, APV, blocked these signals.","715":"Intertidal organisms can spend a great deal of time out of water and must be physiologically adapted to tolerate terrestrial conditions. I hypothesized that one of the physiological adaptations made by intertidal organisms is reduction of metabolic rate during the low tide period. To test this hypothesis, I investigated the ability of the intertidal porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes, to regulate its heart rates during the transition from water to air. Heart beats were monitored by impedance electrodes at 100 C, 150 C, and 200 C during one hour of immersion followed by one hour of emersion. Heart rates were recorded using a PowerLab data acquisition system and were averaged for each 10 minute period of the experiment. Linear regression analysis was used to determine if heart rate varied with body size using crabs with carapace width ranging from 9mm to 16 mm. A significant increase in heart rate with body size was found. Heart rates were corrected for body size in comparisons of the effects of emersion. No significant effect of emersion was found (p-value of 0.079.) The temperature dependence (Q10 ) of heart rate also did not differ between immersion or emersion. In future studies, variables such as size should be more strenuously controlled for, and this may yield clearer results","716":"In this study I examined the endogenous levels of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 72 and Hsp 74) in response to cold shock in the Tegula congeners T. funebralis, T. brunnea, and T. pulligo. Snails were exposed to seawater temperatures of either 10C or 40C (+0.50C) for either 2 or 10 hours, then placed back in ambient (130C) seawater. Levels of heat shock protein (Hsp) expression were quantified via western analysis after 2 and 10 hours of recovery in ambient temperature seawater. These levels were compared to control levels of Hsps recorded in snails not exposed to any cold treatment. In snails facing 10-hour exposure times, levels of Hsp 72 remained constant or decreased slightly relative to the control levels after 2 hours of recovery, while Hsp 72 levels after 10 hours of recovery were significantly lower than the control values. In contrast, levels of Hsp 72 expression in snails exposed for only 2 hours were not significantly different from control values after 10 hours of recovery. These data suggest that different exposures may confer different signals that activate distinct physiological responses to cold shock. If Hsps were detrimental to recovery from cold stress, longer exposures could result in down regulation in the levels of these proteins.","717":"The spread and impact of invasive species is a major threat to ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. Understanding the dynamics of invasions is vital for successful management of estuaries and wilderness areas worldwide. The reef building tubeworm, Ficopomatus enigmaticus adds hard, complex structure to Elkhorn Slough, an environment without much native hard substrate; Ostrea lurida, a native oyster, creates the only analogous microhabitat. To determine if changes in community structure are associated with the introduction of F. enigmaticus reefs, 10 cm diameter cores from both types of biogenic microhabitats were collected from intertidal sites in Elkhorn Slough. Three sites were sampled, one with both F. enigmaticus and O. lurida, one with only O. lurida, and one with only F. enigmaticus; each site comprised 3 cores. Cores were sieved to >500 \u00b5m in the field, preserved, and all organisms were sorted to species and counted. Of the 24 species found in the cores, 7 are not native to Elkhorn Slough. Average number of individuals per core was much larger in F. enigmaticus (177.67) than O. lurida (69) and F. engimaticus harbored, on average, 18.78 times more invasive individuals than O. lurida. The ratio of invasive to native individuals, however, is similar in both (4.73 and 3.75, respectively). Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and analysis of similarity showed clear segregation between habitat types and among sites. However, analysis of similarity using data for invasive species only showed significant dissimilarity between habitat types (P = .006), dissimilarity between sites was not significant (P = .084). Dissimilarity between habitat types was driven primarily by the abundances of four invasive species, Monocorophium insidiosum, Melita nitida, Tubificoides brownae and Streblospio benedicti.","718":"Of all organisms on Earth, invertebrates of the rocky intertidal zones experience some of the most extreme and varied environments, from near freezing seawater to hot, dry sunlight. Thus, these organisms experience an unusually large range of potentially lethal body temperatures. Lottia digitalis, a high intertidal limpet of the Pacific North American coast, is one such creature. What is the thermal tolerance of Lottia digitalis, and how often do they see these body temperatures? The lethal temperature limits of L. digitalis were found, in air, to vary depending on length of exposure time. At ten minutes of heat exposure, limpet survivorship (tested 24 hours after exposure) declined from 100% to 0% as temperature increased from 41 to 45\u00b0 Celsius. At three hours and forty minutes of exposure, a similarly steep decline was noted, but at a lower range of temperatures: from 37 to 40\u00b0 C. A heat-budget model was constructed to find how near L. digitalis live to their thermal maxima, and how often these maxima are exceeded. A heat budget is a mathematical model that predicts the body temperature of an organism, based on records of past environmental conditions plus physical characteristics of the organism. A comparison between the heat extremes predicted by the heat-budget model and the thermal limits showed that L. digitalis approaches within 5\u00b0 C of its thermal limit once every 12 years (on average). L. digitalis do not live as close to their thermal limit as other intertidal organisms, but their preference for living on exposed rock surfaces may make them susceptible to an increase in climatic air temperature","719":"Organisms occupying rocky intertidal habitats are exposed to extreme temperature fluctuations. Given the pervasive effects of temperature on physiological function, large changes in gene expression would be expected in these organisms as temperature varies. Gene expression at elevated temperatures was investigated in vitro using gill tissue from the mussel Mytilus californianus. Tissues were exposed to temperatures between 20.1 and 36.2\u00b0 C, and differential expression was evaluated using a 4224 cDNA Mytilus microarray. At 33\u00b0 C, mRNA levels for hsp70 were induced 60 to 110-fold compared to the control temperature. Several other genes coding for proteins involved in protein folding (hsp20), degradation of denatured polypeptides (sequestosome 1), apoptosis (fos-related antigen 2), and other activities appeared to be induced with elevated temperature. mRNA levels for most genes were greatly reduced at 36.2\u00b0 C, suggesting a deleterious effect of temperature on gene expression (either retardation of induction or greater degradation of mRNA) at this temperature. Simulated mussel body temperatures in excess of 41\u00b0 C were recorded at the collection site. Thus, habitat temperatures may occasionally exceed the thermal tolerance limits of the animal. This is likely to affect the ecology and biogeography of the species.","720":"This study examined behavioral patterns of three intertidal whelks in response to tidal variation. Nucella emarginata, Ocenebra circumtexta, Acanthanucella punctulata have widely overlapping habitat but significantly different resource utilization strategies. All three species were found in the primary study site, a 6m by 9m region of rocky intertidal shore with a vertical range of 0 to +2.5m above MLLW. Individuals were marked and observed at low tide for a two week period to discern basic patterns of movement and aggregation. Following this, surveys of microhabitat and activity were taken of the same area at daily high and low low tides for another two weeks. Acanthanucella were highly responsive to tidal patterns with 76% feeding at high tide and only 27% feeding at low. They also fed significantly more on sun exposed patches of barnacles, often horizontal surfaces, during high tide (66% feeding in sun) than during low tide (21% feeding in sun). Ocenebra show a slight but significant tendency to feed less in the sun at low tide (27%) than at high tide (46%). However, the frequency of feeding in shaded areas does not significantly vary with the tide, possibly because these whelks are unique in utilizing undercut habitat. Nucella appear to have the most conservative behavior, feeding the least at high tide (61%) and showing insignificant response to sun exposure and the timing of the low tide.","721":"The trivalent lanthanide ion gadolinium (Gd3+) has been shown to block various ion channels, particularly in mechanoreceptor systems, in which is has been used in a diagnostic manner. Gd3+ has also been shown to block voltage-gated channels in a number of systems, particularly L-, N-, and T-type Ca channels. The cells of the giant fiber lobe (GFL) of the stellate ganglion of squid are useful in a variety of electrophysiological studies, and their currents are well characterized, although the effects of Gd3+ on these currents have not been studied. We report a lack of effect of 20 mM Gd3+ on K, Na, and Ca currents in these cells, either in voltage-dependent properties or kinetics, although the Ca current (proposed to be due to a P-type Ca channel) warrants further investigation to unequivocally identify it as a Ca current and look for more subtle effects of Gd3+. This study adds to a long list of channels on which the effects of Gd3+ have been studied, and provides some preliminary information on the molecular structure of the pore of P-type Ca channels, as they appear to be insensitive to Gd3+ block at first approximation.","722":"Bisphenol A (BPA), a common chemical found in polycarbonate plastic containers, is suspected to damage animal health. While many studies on BPA have been done on terrestrial vertebrate models, few have been conducted on marine invertebrates. Because BPA is found in harbours, it is important to find out if we need to be concerned about BPA pollution of the marine ecosystem. This study examines the effects of BPA on the early development of the purple sea urchin, \u2733\u25bc\u2752\u274f\u25a0\u2747\u2759\u25cf\u274f\u2743\u2745\u25a0\u25bc\u2752\u274f\u25bc\u25c6\u25b2 \u2750\u25c6\u2752\u2750\u25c6\u2752\u2741\u25bc\u25c6\u25b2. The results show that the vast majority of the embryos develop normally when exposed to concentrations at or below 1 mM up to the late prism stage; a few exogastrulating embryos appear as a result of BPA exposure, but the number of exogastrulating embryos does not increase with increasing concentration. BPA inhibits formation of the blastocoel in S. purpuratus embryos at concentrations greater than 1 mM. At concentrations greater than 5 mM, BPA significantly delays cell division, apparently affecting the mitotic apparatus of the zygote and preventing chromosomes from condensing and migrating properly. The concentrations used in this study are orders of magnitude higher than what has been found in the environment, indicating that BPA may not be of concern in marine ecosystems.","723":"Anthropogenic pollution has widespread impacts on development of marine organisms as myriad chemicals make their way into coastal ecosystems. The present study examined effects of the commonly used herbicide atrazine. Potential effects of atrazine were observed using scyphozoans, model organisms useful as indicators of unbalanced ecosystems, specifically testing effects on cultured planula larvae of the medusa Aurelia labiata. Planula settlement was observed over 14 days in seawater with 3 dilutions of atrazine (l ppb, 10 ppb, and 30 ppb). Turnover time, when population dominance shifted from free-swimming larvae to sessile polyps, was longest in the highest atrazine dilution relative to the control treatment (6.27 days versus 1.96 days, respectively), indicating a significant treatment effect of atrazine (P=0.0015). Similarly, cumulative mortality was higher with increased atrazine concentration. These data suggest atrazine negatively effects development of cnidarians. Scyphozoans are typically more tolerant of poor ocean conditions, therefore these results raise concern for effects on other marine organisms more sensitive to environmental conditions.","724":"Zinc is an essential metabolic heavy metal in all cells. Zinc imbalances in the brain are considered a cause of neurodegenerative disorders. A member of the TRPM cation channel family, TRPM7 is a widely-expressed outwardly-rectifying Ca2+ and Mg2+ channel through which trace metal ions like Zn2+ flow into cells. TRPM7 Ca2+ permeation may be essential for cell viability. While previous characterizations of Zn2+ permeation involved mM levels of Zinc, here we show that TRPM7 is the dominant Zn2+ pathway in HEK-293 cells at 100 mM Zn2+. We performed confocal microscope imaging experiments with the Zn2+ -binding fluorophore FluoZin-3 AM. In the presence of 100 \u00ecMZn2+, HEK-293 cells overexpressing murine TRPM7 load ZN2+ almost 20% more than normal HEK-293 cells. Data for experiments in the presence of physiological levels of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were compared to data for experiments performed in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, indicating that the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Mg2+ inhibited Zn2+ influx.","725":"Juvenile salmon sharks beach yearly along the California coast during late summer and early fall. To determine the epidemiological condition of beached animals, frozen and formalin fixed beached specimens were collected from various Fish and Game facilities for examination and freshly beached specimens were also examined when possible. Histology revealed meningoencephalitis with intralesional bacteria in almost all of the specimens, including the freshly beached sharks, suggesting that this infection plays a role in this unusual behavior. The pathogenic bacteria was cultured from four separate shark specimens, and each isolate was characterized serologically and biochemically as belonging to the genus Carnobacteria. In order to identify the species, we sequenced ~540 bp of the 16s ribosomal DNA and a similarly sized portion of the large ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (ITS or ISR). The 16s sequences obtained from all samples were identical and 99% similar to C. piscicola. The ISR sequences obtained from all samples were also identical to each other, but were only 92% homologous to C. piscicola, and did not match closely with any other sequence in GenBank. This is the first report of Carnobacterium infection in any shark species, though the identity of the pathogenic bacteria remains uncertain.","726":"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) begin reacting to visual stimuli barely after hatching; by seven days, their saccade reflex (quickly flicking the head and eyes towards a stimulus) is fully developed. Therefore, the brain region responsible for these activities \u2013 the optic tectum \u2013 must undergo enormous transformation within this time period. In order to observe the morphology of this transformation, I examined 3-day old, 5-day old, and 7-day old larvae, accessing a variety of techniques. Specifically, I looked at: stained serial sections of whole fish using a conventional light microscope; confocal images of whole and dissected fish after injection with lipophilic FM 1-43FX dye; and scanning electron microscope images of FM 1-43FX-injected fish, which were produced on a recently-invented, serial-sectioning scanning electron microscope. Qualitative analysis reveals that structural change in the tectum is subtle but apparent, with cells proliferating most rapidly along the bilateral axis of the tectal lobes, and along the outermost tips of the distal ventricular branches.","727":"Previous studies have demonstrated that a suite of physiological and biochemical factors contribute to the establishment of a species\u2019 thermal tolerance limits and vertical distribution patterns in the marine intertidal. In this study, the thermal limits of heart function were determined for three congeneric marine snail species of the genus Tegula, all inhabiting discrete vertical zones in the intertidal. T. funebralis is found in the low- to mid-intertidal, T. brunnea in the subtidal to low-intertidal, and T. montereyi in the subtidal zone. Using impedance electrodes, changes in heart rate were monitored in field-acclimatized and lab-acclimated specimens of each species, in response to thermal stresses in water. Significant interspecific differences in Arrhenius break temperature values (ABT, the temperature at which heart rate began a sharp decline) were observed. Average ABTs for field-acclimatized T. funebralis, T. brunnea, and T. montereyi were 31\u00baC, 25\u00baC and 24\u00baC, respectively, establishing a positive correlation between cardiac upper thermal tolerance limits and maximum habitat temperatures. Flatline temperatures, defined as those at which hearts ceased to beat, followed the same trend\u2014T. funebralis hearts stopped beating at significantly higher temperatures than the two subtidal species. In response to cold stress, T. funebralis maintained cardiac function at lower temperatures than its congeners, demonstrating that it is more eurythermal. In all three species, ABTs of specimens lab-acclimated to 22\u00baC were higher than those of 14\u00baC lab-acclimated snails. T. funebralis, however, showed the smallest ABT difference between acclimation temperatures, indicating that it may have a lower capacity for thermal acclimation. The results of this study suggest that the mid-intertidal species T. funebralis is living closer to its upper thermal tolerance limits. Thus T. funebralis populations, and perhaps warm-adapted intertidal species in general, may be at highest risk in the event of global climate change.","728":"The family of TRP ion channels constitutes a fairly recent set of cation channels found in almost all cell types, with diverse roles ranging from mediating responses of nerve growth factors to regulation of temperature and vasorelaxation of blood vessels. Such a plethora of functions also reflect diverse permeability to ions. In this study, the specific member TRPM7 is tested to understand its role in calcium regulation. As an initial test of the possibility that TRPM7 channels contribute to regulation of Ca2+ influx, [Ca2+]i was measured by the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-3-AM, using confocal laser microscopy. In cells in which TRPM7 channel expression was induced and the cells were perfused with Ca2+ - free solution, restoration of extracellular Ca2+ (2mM) caused marked increases in [Ca2+]i; whereas non-induced cells did not show much change in [Ca2+]i. From the proportion of Ca2+ that is taken into the cell, it is plausible that TRPM7 is a vital mode of Ca2+ entry. a second test looked at the effects of Gd3+ (20uM) on Ca2+ influx. The introduction Gd2+ quenched fluo-3 fluorescence, indicating that Gd3+ blocked conductance of Ca2+ through the TRPM7 channel. A final experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of adding Mg2+. Results indicate that the addition of extracellular Mg2+ (2mM) reduces Ca2+ influx. This shows an interaction of both internal and external Mg2+ in the regulation of TRPMY in clocking Ca2+ influx and in allowing Mg2+ influx. Importance of magnesium regulation is indicative of a role for TRPM7 in magnesium homeostasis.","729":"Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a widely expressed, constitutively active, voltage independent ion channel known to be permeable to most divalent and monovalent cations. TRPM7 may play an important role in Ca2+, Mg2+, and trace metal homeostasis. Our study examines the behavior of TRPM7 under physiologically relevant conditions. Confocal laser microscopy and the indicator dye fluo-3\/AM allowed for visualization of intra cellular Ca2+ in response to changes in external Ca2+, indicating that TRPM7 functions as a calcium channel under physiologically appropriate conditions. Our results also indicated that Mg2+ interferes with the movement of Ca2+ through the TRPM7 channel. The data further suggest that the percent of TRPM7 channels blocked by Mg2+ is proportional to the extracellular Mg2+ concentration. This implies a possible mechanism for ion permeation through TRPM7 that involves ion-ion interactions within the channel protein and implicates TRPM7 channels in Ca2+ and Mg2+ homeostasis.","730":"The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is a specific and tightly regulated means by which intracellular proteins, including proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, transcriptional activators, and cell surface receptors, are degraded. Proteins may be degraded because they are no longer needed or because they are mutated, denatured, or misfolded. Each protein substrate is covalently tagged by several 76-amino acid ubiquitin molecules; the tagged protein is degraded by the 26S proteasome complex, releasing free ubiquitin. Deubiquitinating enzymes regulate the generation and recycling of ubiquitin levels in the cell. This field study examined trends in ubiquitin-conjugate levels in Anthopleura elegantissima in order to determine whether overall changes in ubiquitin-conjugate levels are detectable and significant and also to observe the timescale of any such cycles of conjugate build-up and clearing. Levels of ubiquitin-conjugates in the field in A. elegantissima were examined every four hours over a four day period at two sites by Western blots and dot blots using an anti-ubiquitin-conjugate antibody (Lars Tomanek, Somero Lab). Mean pooled intensities of dot blot wells revealed occasional clearing of ubiquitin conjugates over the collection period with no difference between the two sites, suggesting that at some time points, all detectable ubiquitin must be in its free form or itself been degraded. Time series analysis revealed no significant predictive factors that correlated to ubiquitin-conjugate levels. Factors examined were exposure to sun, presence of rain, immersion\/emersion conditions prior to and at the time of sampling, extrapolated tidal height, time of day, and anemone body temperature.","731":"Calcium and cyclic AMP are the two most common cellular \u201csecond messengers\u201d (McHenry 1993). The mechanisms by which their levels are regulated in the cell are complex and the proper functioning of such regulatory systems is essential for life. I investigated the effects of cAMP on intracellular calcium concentrations using HEK-293 cells as a study system. Changes in internal Ca++ concentration were monitored using the fluorescent indicators fluo-3 and fura-2 and both conventional and confocal microscopy. First, cAMP was found to potentiate calcium influx through TRPM7 in cells induced to express the channel. Second, a novel cAMP-induced oscillatory response was observed in both M7-expressing and control cells. Treatment with cyclic GMP did not elicit the oscillatory response. The oscillations persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca++ and were blocked by pretreatment with 1uM thapsigargin, indicating they are solely dependent on the release and reuptake of calcium from internal stores. Oscillations continued in the presence of 10uM ryanodine but were blocked by 100uM 2-APB, suggesting a central role for the IP3 receptor and not the ryanodine receptor. Treatment with the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine yielded mixed results. Oscillations persisted in some cells but were more prolonged and less frequent. This suggests that the underlying mechanism may involve phosphorylation, but the targets and identity of the phosphorylating enzyme remain unclear","732":"The algal-cnidarian symbiosis is a useful system for investigating patterns of selection and adaptation different from standard single-organism models. Current research, mostly focused on tropical ecosystems, indicates that the host\/symbiont relationship can be flexible: hosts can house different symbionts under different conditions. This flexibility may allow for adaptation of the entire symbiotic system (holosymbiont) rather than the individual players. However, less is known about the behavior of temperate algal-cnidarian systems. In this study, I examine the fine scale dinoflagellate symbiont biogeography in the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima, as first observed by LaJeunesse and Trench (2000). Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA indicates a complex transition zone from Cape Mendecino (N40\u00ba 24', W124\u00ba 23') to Salt Point (N38\u00ba 33', W123\u00ba 20'), with anemones to the north harboring Symbiodinium muscatinei and those to the south co-harboring S. muscatinei and S. californium. S. californium is present in the north and south of the transition zone, but absent from the center. A new RFLP signature was found in anemones from the center of the transition zone, suggesting the presence of a third dinoflagellate species endemic to that area.","733":"Although the functional role of the optic tectum has yet to be well characterized in teleosts, it is thought to be responsible for initiating and coordinating visuomotor behaviors associated with the looming response. In this study, behavioral and electrophysiological responses to the looming stimulus were measured by differential suction electrodes at the optic tectum and retinal ganglion cells of adult male zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). The looming stimulus was simulated by a light-emitting diode and by increasing irradiance durations. Responses to off-light events were found at both the retina and optic tectum, suggesting that light-induced startle responses begin as early in the visual synaptic pathway as the retina. However, several differences in signal shape and amplitude between recordings at these two regions suggest that higher-order visual processing of on- and off-responses occurs at the optic tectum. Latency times were measured between the presentation of the stimulus and the onset of the response, but data are currently inconclusive. Habituation was observed through decreases in startle response as a function of flash repetition. Future studies are necessary to correlate electrode position with signal strength to resolve neural organization at the optic tectum. Other parameters such as flash duration, interstimulus interval, and age of the zebrafish can also be varied to obtain a more complete understanding of the startle response.","734":"Zebrafish has long been a model organism for studying the visual system. They have a similar visual system as higher vertebrates but lack a visual cortex. Instead, higher order visual processing occurs in the optic tectum. Previous studies of the zebrafish visual system have used mainly electrophysiological techniques to record wide field responses. We have developed a new technique for perfusing and calcium imaging of live adult zebrafish. This technique allows for simultaneously recording of response in large neuronal populations and activity in neuronal processes as small as 2-5 um. Zebrafish was immersed in and perfused over the gills with physiological 75% Hank's solution in a custom-built perfusion system. Optic tectum of zebrafish was exposed in a dissection and microinjected with fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo3. Confocal microscope was used to image calcium activity in dendrites in the optic tectum receiving input from the retina. A train of light flashes given in five-second intervals was used as stimulus. Time series of responses were recorded at two frames per second. Graphical analysis reveals that dendritic responses to stimuli showed different activity levels and oscillation patterns compared with control, but responses were not time-locked to stimuli. Responses varied between dendrites, with both excitation and inhibition evident. Neighboring dendrites showed a higher correlation in activity, suggesting synchronization of neuronal populations in response to light stimuli.","735":"Invasive species have become an important concern for marine ecosystem function and conservation. Many studies have shown the negative effects of an exotic species on native species through increased competition or other behavioral changes. My study examined three mussels of the genus Mytilus found along the central coast of California, each with a unique life history and ecological characteristics. M. californianus, the ribbed mussel, is a native species that forms dense beds in rocky intertidal habitats; the native blue mussel, M. trossulux, and the invasive blue mussel, M. galloprovincialis, are found in bays and estuaries. Mytilus galloprovincialis, which entered California waters some time in the middle of the 20th century, has replaced the native blue mussel from Southern California up to the latitude of Monterey Bay,","736":"Endosymbiotic algae, commonly of the genus Symbiodinium, are important in the life cycles of many marine invertebrates. Being aware of the diversity of algal symbionts in species of symbiont-containing invertebrates is a first step towards understanding host-symbiont interactions and what adaptive advantages these interactions provide. The symbionts of a common California intertidal sea anemone, Anthopleura sola, were surveyed across a latitudinal gradient of approximately 800 km. A. sola samples were collected at six sites from Monterey Bay to San Diego, California. Analysis of the chloroplast 23s ribosomal RNA gene showed three distinct types of Symbiodinium (types I, II, III). Data show previously unknown diversity in Anthopleura symbionts in a tri-partite latitudinal replacement of Symbiodinium types. Type I was the only Symbiodinium haplotype present in Monterey, the northernmost site. Going south, it was still the dominant type in Big Sur, but type III was also present in low levels. Only type lll was present in the Santa Barbara Channel. The final three, low latitude sites, White's Point, Dana Point, and Cabrillo Point, were populated with types II and III. Type II was more common at White's Point and Dana Point, while type III was more common at the southernmost site, Cabrillo Point. Results suggest that type I is a cold-adapted Symbiodinium, type II is cool-adapted, and type III is warm-adapted.","737":"When a mussel is subjected to rapidly increasing temperatures, its heart rate will sharply decrease above a critical temperature (Hcrit). Previous studies have suggested that this sudden drop in heart rate may be triggered by a behavioral adaptation to environmental stress, valve closure. This behavior would lower the amount of oxygen available for aerobic metabolism, which could necessitate a decrease in cardiac activity. My study examined the temporal patterns of heart rate and relative valve position (open versus closed) in specimens of ribbed mussel (Mytilus californianus) exposed to controlled heating in water. Heart rate data and valve motion were gathered using, respectively, impedance electrodes inserted into the pericardial space and Hall-effect sensors attached to the mussel valves. The mussels were monitored over the course of a 2.7 hour period, during which water temperature was increased from 14\u00ba C to 34\u00ba C. On average valves were more closed after Hcrit than before (P< 0.0001). However, valve closure began prior to Hcrit, and the mussels reached their most closed position after Hcrit had been surpassed. Thus there was no evidence that complete valve closure occurred before heart rate decline. Therefore, the fall in heart rate above Hcrit cannot be ascribed to a simple behavioral response, complete value closure. Future studies should quantify the responses of valve movement to other factors, such as decreasing water salinity and emersion effects, that are also linked to changes in mussel heart rates to gain further insight into the relationship between valve movement and heart function.","738":"Propranolol is a non-selective \u03b2-blocker that has recently proven useful in the treatment of social anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Recollection of a memory requires that the memory pathway is strengthened by continual re-visitation. This re-visitation requires the activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors by catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, two important signalers in the fight-or-flight stress response. Propranolol blocks this activation and thus prevents the strengthening of memory pathways. Most previous studies have utilized either human or rodent study subjects. Zebra fish provide a unique opportunity to examine an organism with a different scale of neuro-complexity and a more accessible genome, which could eventually lead to a greater understanding of how the \u03b2-receptor memory coupling functions. The fish (Danio rerio) were trained to associate tapping on the glass of their aquarium with a positive (Tap+Food), negative (Tap+Net), or neutral experience (Tap). The control fish (No Tap) were not exposed to tapping during the three week training process. After re-activation of the memory, propranolol was dissolved in the water for an overall concentration of 27\u03bcM. The anxiety levels and memory retention of the fish were then tested after 1, 2, 3 and 18 hours. Preliminary data suggest that propranolol has a clear impact on the anxiety levels of the negative, neutral and control fish and may have some impact on the positive fish. Additionally, propranolol decreases the clarity and accuracy of spatial memory in fish trained using positive reinforcement. This study demonstrates that \u03b2-receptors and memory recall are tightly coupled throughout evolution, despite differences in neuro-complexity. Future studies should utilize a larger number of replicates to yield statistical significance and a slightly lower concentration of propranolol as 27\u03bcM seems to be at the threshold of toxicity in these fish.","739":"When two colonies of the tunicate, Botryllus schlosseri, encounter one another, they can either undergo vascular fusion or trigger a rejection reaction that blocks fusion. This interaction is a form of allorecognition. Allorecognition is the ability to recognize self from non-self, and in B. schlosseri, the outcome of the allorecognition process is determined by a single, highly-polymorphic fusion-histocompatibility (FuHC) locus. Another highly polymorphic gene that encodes a DnaJ-related protein has been found in the FuHC locus. The function of this gene is unknown, but the gene is of particular interest because it shows a high level of polymorphism and it may also function in allorecognition. In this study, DnaJ was characterized genetically in order to look for patterns of polymorphism and population structure. The DnaJ gene was sequenced from three California populations and two Woods Hole populations. The sequences showed a high level of polymorphism, with an average of 82.6 polymorphic sites and 33.35 pairwise differences within populations. However, the gene showed no population structure (FST=0) and 100% of the variation was attributable to within population variation. A locus by locus AMOVA showed the least amount of variation was attributable to variation between the California and Woods Hole groups. These results suggest either incomplete lineage sorting or balancing selection for genetic diversity. The high amount of variation in this gene is unprecedented and may indicate a particular role in its function.","740":"Seamounts are topographic features that extend upwards a thousand meters or more from the ocean floor, but peak below the water's surface. Initial studies of seamount biota proposed a high level of endemicity on seamounts. However, further work has called this assumption into question. For the first time, global biogeographic ranges have been gathered for a marine assemblage, namely that of the Davidson Seamount (~35.7\u00b0 N, 122.7\u00b0 W). Only five percent of Davidson fauna are localized to this seamount, with the majority observed over a continuum of geographic ranges. As further evidence against the endemicity hypothesis, eighty percent of the fauna have been found over a thousand kilometers away from Davidson Seamount. Moreover, taxonomic and sampling improvements have the potential to increase this figure, which suggests that most deep-sea assemblages are composed of widely distributed species.","741":"Previous studies have demonstrated that physiological and biochemical factors, including adaptation to temperature and salinity, may contribute to the success of an invasive species in competition with a native species. Mytilus galloprovincialis, a blue mussel native to the Mediterranean, is a successful invader along the west coast of California, out-competing the native blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, over much of its range south of the San Francisco Bay. Previous research has studied cardiac function, enzyme biochemistry, and gene expression as factors that have led to M. galloprovincialis\u2019 successful invasion. Enzyme biochemistry, however, has only been studied in the laboratory, using specimens acclimated to common conditions. The objective of my study was to gain an accurate depiction of potential for metabolic function in field-acclimatized congeners of blue mussels collected from a site where both species and their hybrids occur. Estimates of potential metabolic rate were obtained by assaying the activity of two enzymes that are important in ATP production: malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS). Specimens were collected from Bodega Bay harbor, genotyped to their respected species (including hybrids), and enzyme assays were conducted. M. trossulus had a significantly higher activity for both MDH and CS, relative to M. galloprovincialis (one-way ANOVA tests). The hybrids' MDH and CS activities fell between those of M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis. To determine if size-dependence (\u201cscaling\u201d) of metabolic rate contributed to these differences, I used linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between body size (length of shell) and enzymatic activity. When all genotypes\u2019 MDH and CS activities and mussel size were compared, a significant negative correlation was evident. When the species were analyzed separately, however, the correlations were not significant. The higher activities of MDH and CS in M. trossulus are consistent with this congener being more cold-adapted (able to sustain a high metabolic rate at low temperatures) than the Mediterranean invasive. Furthermore, the hybrids are adapted to both warm and cold water, and can survive in a middle climate range. These data correlate to the mapped distributions of the genotypes along the California coast and to the previous knowledge of the physiological differences between the species.","742":"The thermal tolerance ranges of fish and the temperatures at which a fish performs optimally are established by the evolutionary history and recent thermal exposure of the organism. Some species of fish are highly eurythermal; they tolerate a wide range of temperatures and, typically, exhibit a significant capacity to alter thermal tolerance limits and thermal optima for physiological function as a result of acclimation. An excellent example of a eurythermal fish is the goby Gilliclrtltys mirabilis. commonly known as the long-jaw mudsucker, which is found in waters whose temperatures range between approximately 9\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. In this experiment, I used G. mirabilis acclimated for four weeks to four different temperatures (9\u00b0, 14\u00b0, 19\u00b0 and 26\u00b0C) to study the effects ofacute decreases in ambient temperature on heart rate, atemperature. The respective heart rates are compared at shared temperatures to identify the ability of the fish to meet the aerobic demand posed at each temperature. Heart rate decreased with temperature at a constant rate in the fish acclimated at 9\u00b0C and 14\u00b0C. The heart rate of the fish acclimated at 19\u00b0C and 26\u00b0C decreased at a constant rate until reaching 20 beats per minute, which occurred at temperatures near 9\u00b0C for the 19\u00b0C fish and 15\u00b0C for the 26\u00b0C fish. A 20 beat per minute heart rate was maintained until the temperature dropped below 5\u00b0C, at which point the heart rate declined exponentially. At 1\u00b0C the 9\u00b0 and 14\u00b0C acclimated fish maintain a heart rate of over twice that of the 19\u00b0 and 26\u00b0C acclimated fish, suggesting that temperature acclimation shifts the thermal window of animals. This experiment could be used in conjunction with an experiment raising the temperature of G. mirabilis acclimated at the same temperatures so that both the upper and lower thermal limits of cardiac function of the fish are discovered","743":"Climate change has already begun to change species abundances and distributions within intertidal habitats. Monitoring such changes over time provides valuable information about potential shifts in ecosystem dynamics. Congeners of the sea anemone Anthopleura are conspicuous members of intertidal communities along the North American Pacific coast. Previous studies have shown that these congeners differ in their latitudinal habitat range. This study attempted to discern the distribution of anemones in the intertidal at Hopkins Marine Station. It found that A. xanthogrammica were significantly more abundant in the exposed areas on the western side of the point, while A. sola were significantly more abundant on the relatively protected eastern side of the point. These distributions were correlated with temperature\u2014the body temperatures of immersed A. xanthogrammica were significantly lower than those of A. sola. Potential decreases in the more cold-adapted A. xanthogrammica and increases in the warm-adapted A. sola may occur as climate change ensues, and this study provides a baseline against which future distribution studies may be compared.","744":"Levels of fecal-associated bacteria that may be harmful to human health can be very high near haul-out sites of marine mammals. Water from sites near Seal Beach at Hopkins Marine Station and from varying distances from the haul-out site was tested for bacterial abundance with both epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and was not found to have increased total numbers of bacteria near the haul-out site, even though it has been shown that the microbial community at these sites is different than others around Monterey Bay. There was, however, significant variation in bacterial abundance based on the day the sample was taken. Various environmental factors including number of seals on the beach, water temperature, air temperature, and wind speed were compared to the daily mean bacterial abundance counts to test for a significant effect. Sea surface temperature was found to have the strongest correlation on bacterial abundance of the factors tested.","745":"Some of the most interesting aspects of a kelp forest ecosystem are the herbivore kelp interactions. Macrocystis pyrifera utilizes different methods to deter consumption by herbivores. Both nutrient levels and defensive chemical concentrations may be allocated differently to the different tissues of the kelp, showing defensive preference for those tissues responsible for growth and reproduction. We examined this nutrient allocation as well as differential distribution of polyphenolic concentrations in three different tissue types (mature blades, apical meristems, sporophylls, and drift kelp) of Macrocystis pyrifera, and those from drift kelp, and analyzed how these differences affected the growth of the herbivore Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Sea urchins were fed restricted diets of a single type of algal tissue for 14 days, and their growth rates were compared. Urchins fed a diet of mature blades experienced the strongest growth, as mature blades had low concentrations of polyphenols and high nutritional value. Urchins fed diets of both sporophylls and apical meristems experienced the least growth, as sporopyll and apical meristem tissue palatability was low, due to either low nutrient levels (sporophylls) or high polyphenolic concentrations (apical meristems). Urchins fed diets of drift kelp had strong growth rates, because although drift kelp was low in nutrients, the tissue also contained low polyphenolic concentrations. We concluded both nutrient allocation as well as differential polyphenolic concentrations both played roles in palatability of kelp tissues and their effect on herbivore growth rates.","746":"The study of superoxide dismutase and Catalase is important due to their role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species. Our understanding of the functioning of these enzymes is forwarded through the assaying the activity of these enzyme in Mytilus californianus over small spatial and temporal scales. Superoxide dismutase appears to be extremely variable from individual to individual and may not be a useful tool to generalize about reactive oxygen species trends. While statistical significance is lacking, the patterns which emerge from the Catalase activity yield compelling arguments to continue the use of the intertidal as a study system to determine the scale on which these enzymes vary and what factors drive this variation.","747":"Changes to the physiology or chemistry of basal producers can have direct consequences for consumers and the transfer of energy between trophic levels. As a foundation species, giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera sustains high growth rates and primary productivity under dense shading canopies through an efficient system of translocation that provides energy and nutrients to growing tissues. This study investigated what impact removing the growing point or apical meristem from M. pyrifera, as occurs in storms, commercial harvest and historically in grazing by the Stellar's sea cow, has on the physiology of the remaining immature sub-apical blades. Blades from fronds experienced increased growth and erosion rates within the first week after removal of the apical meristem as compared with controls. After two weeks growth and erosion rates were no longer significantly different between manipulated blades and control but substantial differences in concentrations of the sugar mannitol as well as nitrogen and carbon content persisted. The study revealed physiological effects of apical meristem loss that merit further investigation as to their causal mechanisms and suggest the potential for meristem removal to alter interactions with primary

signaling is known to be critical for proper embryonic development in most animals studied to date15. But key evolutionary questions on the origin and evolution of this pathway in the metazoan common ancestor are still unresolved. Recently, the genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, a member of the early branching metazoan linage ctenophora, has been sequenced. Insights into the function of the Wnt pathway in P. bachei will provide information on early evolution of this key pathway. Three Wnt ligand genes were identified in P. bachei and cloned for in situ hybridization. These genes showed expression in the combs, tentacles, mouth, ciliated grooves and polar fields of the adult P. bachei. In a genomic search for other members of the canonical Wnt pathway, components of the destruction complex and antagonists were incomplete or missing from the genome. Wnt expression in the adult P. bachei indicates that Wnt could also be playing a role in neurotransmission in the adult.","3903":"The evolution of multicellular animals required the development of epithelial tissues that function in controlling the transport of molecules from one environment to another. Collagen proteins are crucial to the formation of epithelial tissues, and are therefore critical in understanding the origins of multicellularity and Metazoa. We looked for collagen type IV proteins in the recently sequenced Ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei genome, to assess whether this most basal of Metazoa phylum could contain conserved collagen proteins. We used Homo sapiens collagen type IV sequences and Blasted against the Moroz lab P.bachei genome server to search for collagen type IV proteins. We found that P. bachei possesses 6 distinct type IV alpha chains along three scaffolds, two of which were aligned in a head-to-head fashion, indicating both traditional and inverted gene duplication events. Given recent evidence suggesting that Ctenophores are possibly the most basal of the Metazoans, our findings suggest that the common ancestor to all Metazoa contained a much more developed collagen profile than previously appreciated.","3904":"There has been a long debate in the scientific community over the oldest surviving metazoan lineage. Traditionally it has been taught that Porifera, the sponges, occupy that nitche possessing a diploblastic body plan without true organs; however recent phylogentic analysis has suggests that Ctenophora may truly be the oldest lineage, free floating animals with a possible mesoderm layer and complex organs. In this study we searched for the presence of mesoderm in Ctenophora by examining the genome of Pleurobrachia bachei for the presence of tropomyosin, calponin, and \u0152\u2264-catenin. Gene expression for all three were found not only in the muscular regions of P. bachei, but in the epidermal tissues as well, indicating there is an unknown function in the metazoan common ancestor. Homology comparisons to the rest of Metazoa reveal little about tropomyosin and calponin, however the ctenophore \u0152\u2264-catenin protein appears to be to least derived of all metazoans and suggests Ctenophora may be the most basal extant metazoan lineage.","3905":"The evolution of the nervous system is poorly understood, with broad implications in basic neuroscience and regenerative medicine. The unintuitive nervous system of the basal Ctenophores provides an insight into neuronal evolution. We developed a Zero-Click computational pipeline for secretory peptide prediction from raw genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic sources (Girardo, 2012), in search of novel signaling pathways. This pipeline was applied to gene models produced from our Pleurobrachia bachei genome, initiated in July 2009 (Moroz, 2012), to obtain a list of 38 putative secretory peptides (Citarella, 2012). 10 of these peptides with no direct homology were selected for cloning and in situ hybridization. Many predicted products localize to neuronal structures, indicating a more complex neuropeptide signaling network than previously described in Ctenophore.","3906":"Brachyury is a transcription factor important for mesoderm formation in chordates. Ctenophores are basal metazoans with little known about their germ layer organization. For this reason, brachyury was used as a possible mesodermal marker in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei . The gene was cloned and then used for in situ hybridizations in adults. This revealed distinctive expression patterns in the tentacles and combs of the animal, with banding patterns indicative of possible muscle cells. The Pb brachyury sequence was also used to help validate extant gene models. It was found that these models did not correctly predict the brachyury gene structure. For this reason, the gene models were updated with new training data. The results of this were still pending at the time this paper was completed (June 1, 2012). Further research also needs to be done on brachyury expression in Pleurobrachia bachei embryos to completely understand its role in ctenophore development.","3907":"LIM homeobox (Lhx) gene family consists of six subfamilies of patterning genes which play a major role in the development of the nervous system and are found only in animals. We looked at their presence and expression in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei to study their evolution and development. Ctenophores are among the most basal metazoans and one of the first animals to have a nervous system. We found four Lhx genes in P. bachei, Lhx1\/5, Lhx3\/4, Islet and Lmx, with our gene prediction models. Lhx2\/9 and Lhx6\/8, the other two subfamilies in most metazoans, were absent. None of these genes would clone using an adult cDNA library but Lhx3\/4 and Lmx were successfully cloned using an embryonic cDNA library. Ctenophores and sponges are the only taxons that have four Lhx gene families instead of six. According to this genomic data, ctenophores and sponges are the most basally branched metazoans. Further research will be needed to understand the role that the Lhx gene family plays in the evolution and development of nerves in ctenophores.","3908":"Ctnenophores are a group of marine, jelly like, comb bearing metazoans. This phylum consists of an estimated 100-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00ea200 species (Mills CE, 2012). Ctenophores are similar to cnidarians in that they have a homologous mesoderm consisting of a jelly like substance called mesoglea. They differ in that they do not have venomous stinging nematocysts but instead have numerous sticky colloblasts lining the tentacles. They also differ in locomotion, cnidarians typically use a contracting pulse of the bell to propel themselves, whereas, ctenophores use 8 rows of ctene plates that paddle the animal through the water. It is believed that they have true striated muscle and a primitive central nervous system (CNS) consisting of the aboral organ and polar fields. The Aboral organ is composed of a balancing statocyst that is attached to all ctene rows by a series of balancers and ciliated furrows. Signaling occurs from the aboral organ to the ctene rows. Each row is capable of beating separately from any of the others, indicating a complex signaling. Extending from this CNS are two nerve nets. One nerve net is located in the ectoderm while the other extends through the mesodermal mesoglea. Genetic data and morphology are both used in comparing basal metazoans and determining evolutionary ancestors.","3909":"Suspended-sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the Elwha River and nearshore environment off the river mouth were observed in order to determine the effects of the Elwha dam removal project on sediment supply to the river and marine environment. River gauge data over a 4-month period of dam removal from November 2011 to March 2012 was analyzed to identify deconstruction-caused SSC increases. Nearshore SSC was measured over the same period and was compared to oceanic and river data to determine controls on nearshore SSC levels. The 2011-2012 data was compared to data from a 2008 study to see what effects dam removal has had on SSC levels. The river had a background SSC level of about 100 mg L-1 with a maximum observed concentration of 2610 mg L-1. Nearshore SSC had a background level of 0-20 mg L-1 during the study with periodic events reaching levels of 50 mg L-1 and a maximum of 121 mg L-1 on March 30. The highest recorded river SSC levels corresponded with major deconstruction events, while the highest recorded nearshore SSC levels corresponded with strong sediment input from the river. Comparison with the 2008 data was made difficult by the large difference in river discharge between the two study periods. Dam removal resulted in pulses of sediment to the river that were measurable off the mouth of the river, indicating that deconstruction had a direct on effect on SSCs in both the river and nearshore environment.","3910":"For almost a century, the Elwha River has been constrained by the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, which have severely restricted the transport of fine sediment downriver. The dams are currently undergoing removal; it is the largest such project ever attempted in the United States. The purposes of this experiment were to identify the macrobenthos currently living on the subaqueous delta and determine the potential impacts of dam removal, and the ensuing sediment influx, on macrobenthic diversity. Samples of benthic organisms and sediment were collected from the delta floor, inventoried and analyzed, and the results mapped to find correlations between the two. The results showed patterns suggesting a correlation between grain size and diversity, with the greatest diversity at sites with high percentages of gravel, and the lowest diversity at sites with high percentages of mud. These findings demonstrate the importance of sediment size and sorting on the diversity of the Elwha delta. Given that the sediment in Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills is expected to continue traveling downstream, this information can be used to predict how the dam removal will impact macrobenthic communities on the delta, including economically important species such as clams, geoducks and crabs.","3911":"Grain-size distribution, one of important parameters reflecting sediment sources, transportation, and deposition, helps people understand and predict shoreline and bathymetric changes. For this study, wave-orbital velocity and tidal bed shear stress were compared to grain-size distribution of the Elwha River delta in order to find correlations between physical processes and the seabed composition. Grain-size distributions of sediments from the river, the bluff, and the delta were also examined to determine sources of sediments from the delta. The sand-dominant region found at the west side of the river mouth and some local landward coarsening patterns suggested that grain-size distribution was under influences of waves. Though no strong correlation was found between tidal bed shear stress and grain-size distribution, other evidence was provided that suggest the impacts of tidal-induced currents on grain-size distribution. We found the poorly sorted region at the western offshore of the river mouth and the coarse-grains dominant regions near the river mouth; it is possibly due to focused and strong currents that causes high bed shear stress in those regions. Moreover, tidal-induced currents have a net northeastward flow which brings fine sediments toward the east. Therefore, we observed a region of fine sediments at the east of the river mouth. Last, our results suggested that the bluff in Freshwater Bay supplies the delta with coarse sediments and the river mainly provides fine sediments.","3912":"The removal of the two dams on the Elwha River provides a large-scale backdrop for sediment transport research. The demolition will stimulate sediment-laden flows downstream, directly impacting the Elwha delta and the marine environment. This study uses two different tracers to track sediment movement along the Elwha River and in the Strait of Juan de Fuca: beryllium-7 (7Be) and grain texture and mineralogy. The objective of this study is to draw conclusions about the source of sediment reaching the mouth of the river. Using these tracing methods, we found that (1) 7Be functions as a useful tool when researching sediment transport during dam removals, (2) the grains examined at the mouth of the Elwha River are a mixture of both sediment from upriver and from the glacially deposited bluffs along the shoreline, and (3) there is evidence of sediment from the former reservoirs making its way to the delta. The source of sediment reaching the delta is most likely a mixture of normal depositional processes due to fluctuating river discharge and reworking of the river bed sediments due to dam removal as the former reservoirs, Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell, erode into their pre-dammed form.","3913":"The objective of this research was to characterize nutrient concentrations and distributions throughout the Elwha River watershed, focusing on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phosphorus and silicic acid. Previous research has indicated that the Elwha River is oligotrophic, however with the removal of the dams comes the subsequent discharge of a large fraction of the 1.9x106 m3 of sediment trapped behind the dams. Understanding the nutrient composition and distribution relative to grain size and suspended sediments will provide scientists with perspective as to how the ecosystem is going to react to dam removal. Sediments and their pore water were collected in the field and analyzed. Additional data was included from U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Ecology. The culmination of this data demonstrates that the upper stretches of the Elwha River are nutrient poor but the recent removal of the two dams has led to an increase of nutrients within the nearshore environment, which is hypothesized to be related to the discharge of sediment based on this research. Implications for future studies can be made that refer to primary productivity, riparian health and the return of salmon.","3914":"The delivery and deposition of particulate organic carbon (POC) into the marine environment via rivers impacts local biological and geological processes as well as the global carbon cycle. This is especially the case in small mountainous rivers, such as the Elwha River, Washington, which delivers a significant fraction of particulate organic carbon to the Strait of Juan de Fuca annually. Recently, the Elwha has begun undergoing dam deconstruction. To study the resulting fluctuations of POC in response to dam removal, water and seabed samples were collected and analyzed using loss on ignition to estimate levels of POC. The concentrations of suspended sediments in the water column and compositions of grain size in the marine seabed sediments were also examined. Seabed samples were found to contain higher concentrations of POC compared to surface water samples. POC levels increased when more suspended material was present in the river, and also when seabed samples consisted primarily of mud. Overall, the major concentrations of POC occurred below the Glines Canyon and Elwha Dams, where sediment is being released and eroded due to dam removal processes, and also in the river mouth, which is an area of high turbidity.","3915":"Using digital photographs, this study investigates sediment movement eastwards by the dominant northwest swell in Freshwater Bay, WA. Twenty samples were taken at five locations and analyzed with the Cobble cam analysis package. It was found that sand and smaller pebbles were more prevalent on the western updrift shore than on the delta face and that no silt and clay were found on the foreshore. Sand was not evident on the most eastern site and mean sediment grain size increased eastward. Wave rays hit the western face of the delta orthogonal to the shore and result in more pronounced cusps in the eastern direction. The westerly portion experiences oblique waves and results in longshore transport eastward in Freshwater Bay. Pacific Ocean swell from the west had the most impact while local wind-generated waves from the northeast and northwest had the least. Pebbles were selectively moved by the wave regime for each section of beach. All the sediment along the western delta was removed and indicates that longshore transport is sediment starved.","3916":"The mysid Archaeomysis grebnitzkii is a small detrivorous crustacean that is prey to many low level consumers. In vitro, we fed A. grebnitzkii fresh and aged blended Nereocystis luetkeana as well as a blend of phytoplankton and measured preference and differential growth between these diets. We were unable to detect feeding preference or changes in length or weight, however the fresh kelp treatment had a much higher mortality rate than the other treatments, a result we were able to reproduce in a second trial.","3917":"Our study seeks to gain more information on the migration and feeding patterns of two common intertidal carnivorous snails, Nucella lamellosa and Nucella ostrina. These whelks are native to the western coast of the United States ranging from California to Alaska and feed primarily on barnacles. The information from our study will be useful in determining some of the effects of global climate change on the intertidal ecosystem. Because of the predatory feeding pattern of these animals they are important in determining what else can live in the region. We gained more clarity on the patterns exhibited by these snails during the period between feeding peaks by observing the counts and densities within a plot on the shoreline as well as the movement of tagged individuals. We found that although there was no feeding peak during our study, and therefore no mass vertical migration, the N. lamellosa did appear to be feeding in a higher percentage higher up the shore. We also gained some insight into the effects of radio tagging on snail behavior when we discovered that that radio tagged N. lamellosa appeared lower on the shore than those without radio tags. This information will help further studies on whelks.","3918":"Phytoplankters are primary producers and an important energy source within pelagic nearshore habitats. The growth of these organisms is affected by riverine-oceanic interactions. A measurable interaction over 24 hours is the density difference between these water sources, where less-dense riverine water is warmer and has lower salinity. Ebb currents enhance the advection of riverine output, placing it on top of the oceanic water and creating stratification. Primary production increased during stratification periods, but reduced when transitioning between a flood and ebb current. Visual analysis of phytoplankton community composition also highlighted increases in the population during high ebb and flood current rates. The large increase in Skeletonema population during this study suggested that the movement or growth of certain phytoplankton genera are affected by these water source interactions. This study concludes that since changes happen within the water column over a short period of time, an entire tidal exchange must be monitored before any conclusions can be made about the water column or its occupants.","3919":"Nucella ostrina and Nucella lamellosa are two species of predatory marine intertidal snail. They are common along the coast from California to Alaska, US and prey upon barnacles. We studied vertical migration and feeding patterns of each species and the best method for tagging them. We found that there was not much fluctuation in vertical movement, nor any significant peaks in feeding over our study period; however we did verify that N. lamellosa move up the shore a bit to feed. We also found that radio tagged N. lamellosa were more abundant lower on shore than their typical zone. These studies will help future studies on Nucella spp as well as further advance our efforts in predicting effects of climate change of behavior.","3920":"Drift algal material exported from kelp beds plays a significant role in nearby ecosystems. Phenotypic traits such as gonad index and jaw diameter can be indicators of diet consistency and nutrient uptake and thus can be used to assess the possible role of exported kelp. In this study, individuals of an herbivorous (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) and a filter feeding (Balanus nubilus) species were sampled from near the kelp beds in the shallow subtidal photic environment (SSPE) and far from the kelp beds in the deep subtidal environment (DSE). Urchins in the DSE had significantly larger gonads and jaws in comparison to individuals in the SSPE. I conclude that urchins in the DSE were getting better fed, whether through quantity or quality of food, suggesting that drift algae was being exported from nearby kelp beds. There was no significant difference between barnacle gonad indices with depth suggesting that their particulate organic matter food was equal at both depths. Future studies could examine gut contents to determine if there are diet differences between the two depths.","3921":"Spatial subsidies including particulate organic matter (POM) play an important role in near-shore food web ecology. Fatty acid (FA) analysis has proven an effective tool for constructing these food webs, although the FA profiles of many marine autotrophs and the validity of culturing is still unknown. We cultured the diatom Skeletonema cf. marinoi using dialysis tubes and compared the FA profile to published batch culture FA profiles and to POM FA profiles. PERMANOVA analysis showed that FA profiles of dialysis replicates were not significantly different from each other (p=0.14) but were different from batch culture (p=0.001) and POM data (p=0.0001). FA suites from cultured phytoplankton may delineate specific phytoplankton taxa, but further studies are necessary to determine the most accurate culturing method.","3922":"The mysid Archaeomysis grebnitzkii is an important detritovore and prey in many food webs. In this experiment A. grebnitzkii was feed phytoplankton, blended fresh kelp, and blended aged kelp for 15 days while growth and diet preference were measured. Growth was measured as a molt rate and condition index. The preference was measured by the absorbance of chlorophyll a in solution. Unfortunately, growth was not observed in any of the treatments and chlorophyll a did not provide any indication of preference for a specific diet. Of all the treatments fresh kelp had the least molts and the lowest condition index. A strong negative response to fresh kelp particles was recorded.","3923":"The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effect of water flow on fertilization success of Nereocystis gametophytes and growth rates of young sporophytes. My null hypothesis was that there would be no differences between the flows. However, I found that in my experimental setup, benthic diatoms outcompeted the Nereocystis sporophytes and grew over them. I thus analyzed differences in diatom growth under different water flow treatments, and found that there was a clear trend of more diatom chlorophyll and organic biomass in high flow conditions.","3924":"The objective of this mesocosm experiment is to determine differences in bacteria abundance in normal (600\u0152\u00baatm), medium (1000\u0152\u00baatm), and high (1300\u0152\u00baatm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms serve as an intermediate for lab and field studies; mesocosms provide insight about changes to food webs, communities, and ecosystems.","3925":"Environmental changes can affect the abundance and community structure of various intertidal organisms. Water flow rate is a determining factor in food abundance and settling rate of food particles. For this study, we used the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula, to study the effects of water flow on feeding rate. Many studies have been conducted involving beating rate, that is, how often barnacles extend their cirri. However little research has been done on how flow rates can affect the actual feeding rates of barnacles, meaning the rate at which they obtain food using their cirri. We predicted that in faster moving water barnacles would be able to obtain more food particles due to the flux of food around them. We also predicted that in slower moving water barnacles feeding rate would be lower because settling rate would be higher. These predictions led to the hypothesis that there must be an optimal flow rate at which feeding rate is highest. Our results showed that settling rates of food particles were highest in slower moving water, however, we were unable to obtain enough data about how feeding rates would vary with changing flow rates. In the future, more tests should be done using the improved methods we have developed in order to determine differences in barnacle feeding rates.","3926":"Algae may be an answer to the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future oil crisis but a lot of groundwork needs to be done before algae can provide enough oil to keep up with human consumption. Environmental stresses can cause diatoms to produce higher lipid contents and grow at different than normal rates. Three species of Pacific Northwest diatoms were observed in four different nutrient media, including two nutrient-reduced media, and in two different temperatures for highest growth rates. One species of Fragilaria sp. (strain # F084) showed little or no growth, while another species of Fragilaria sp. (strain # F074) grew best when all essential nutrients were present. Skeletonema sp. sp. (strain # F164) grew well in nutrient reduced media (F\/2+ 1\/2 NaNO3 and F\/2+ 1\/2 NaNO3) , as well as pink F\/2+, and another species of Fragilaria sp. (F074). grew best when all essential nutrients were present. This pilot study is the basis for future experiments into finding which Pacific Northwest diatom may be worthy of algal biofuel candidacy.","3927":"Calcium carbonate shells undergo dissolution in acidified conditions. As carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the ocean's pH is lowered. Lottia scutum is used in this experiment to demonstrate the affect of ocean acidification on calcium carbonate material, which many marine organisms possess. As a limpet's shell becomes brittle its life expectancy may become threatened by environmental conditions such as desiccation, sun and temperature exposure, as well as predation. Peak force from crushing limpet shells is used in this experiment to measure shell strength and show how strength is diminished in acidified water over time.","3928":"Gut contents of two species of sea scallops, Chlamys rubida and C. hastata, were compared for individuals from the San Juan Channel collected in shallow (20m) and deep (~80m) habitats. Gut contents were preserved in paraformaldehyde and an Olympus microscope with 10x and 20x lenses was used to view phytoplankton. Food constituents of different categories were counted using an ocular micrometer transect. No noticeable trends regarding dietary constituents were seen across species or habitat which supports our null hypothesis. A count of identifiable diatoms showed that Thalassiosira and CF Melosira were the most abundant diatoms. In addition, CF Melosira was more abundant (~2x greater) in shallow animals from both species relative to deep animals. The results imply that both species of scallops are consuming similar organic and inorganic matter at different depths.","3929":"Although they are integral to many marine ecosystems, relatively little is known about euendolithic (shell-boring) organisms outside the tropics. Here, I present a short survey of euendoliths inhabiting a site on the Pacific coast of North America. Shells were collected from sites in the intertidal and subtidal zone off Point Caution, on San Juan Island, WA. Casts of boreholes were photographed with a scanning electron microscope, and their morphology and diameter was matched to previously isolated cultures. Several types of green algae, as well as cyanobacteria and fungi, were found in the intertidal shells. The 11 meter deep subtidal site was dominated by the green alga Ostreobium, and the 23 meter site by the cyanobacteria Leptolyngbya. Only heavily eroded tracings were found at the 30 meter deep site.","3930":"Effects of Salinity on Contraction, Expansion, and Locomotion Behaviors of the Sea Anemone Anthopleura elegantissima","3931":"Adult distribution of intertidal bivalve communities is dependent on larval success and juvenile survival. Finding and predicting juvenile presence is crucial to understanding the mechanisms determining adult abundance. I sampled seven intertidal areas on San Juan Island, representing various wave exposures, sediment compositions, and beach slope to determine where juveniles are present and what factors might predict their presence. Juvenile clams were found at six of the seven sites sampled, in highest abundance at British Camp and Bell Point on the northeastern tip of the island, dominated by Nutricola spp. Juveniles of Mysella tumida, Saxidomus giganteus, Protothaca staminea, Macoma inquinata, and Macoma nasuta were also found. Clam assemblages seem to be site-specific, rather than being driven by tidal height or other individual environmental factors. Within sites, shell hash, mud and granules the best predictors of presence or absence of juveniles.","3932":"The proportion of live Crassostrea gigas infected with Polydorid spionid worms was surveyed at several locations around San Juan Island. Thirty infected C. gigas were collected from the Argyle Lagoon locations and worm galleries and holes on the inside and outside of shells were counted and assigned to a shell region. The proportion of borings that penetrate the inner layer of nacre was calculated. The area of each shell region was determined to find the density of worm populations and shells were cut to measure the thickness of different regions. Oyster populations with the highest proportion of infected individuals also had higher per-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00ea shell population densities. The proportion of nacre invasions remained constant as the population density of worms varied. Although the average thickness of the whole shell did not affect the proportion of inner nacre borings, the adductor scar and hinge regions showed a negative correlation between nacre bore holes and thickness.","3933":"The discovery that fossil fuels are not a sustainable fuel source has led to a search for alternatives. Many marine biologists hypothesize that the answer may lie in algae, more specifically in microalgae. The purpose of this pilot study is to provide baseline data for future research for biofuel production. Using cultures exposed to different temperatures and media containing different levels of nutrients, I found that Asterionellopsis glacialis was the best candidate among the algae tested from the Pacific Northwest to pursue for potential biofuel production in warmer climates. This was based on its tolerance to different nutrient levels and temperatures.","3934":"There are many things to consider when setting up experimental laboratories, especially in the context of ocean acidification. We studied the impact of biomass load and flow-through rate on the carbonate chemistry of aquaria at two different levels of pH. We found that all of these factors play a large role in how consistent you can expect to maintain the chemistry of your system. In the flow-through system we observed decreased levels of pH relative to the control tanks for all levels of biomass. Our static experimental system experienced very large fluctuations in chemistry over short time periods. Our results indicate that it is necessary for pilot studies of this nature to be performed before ocean acidification laboratory studies are undertaken. Factors like biological load and flow-through rate are likely to influence the chemistry of any experiment.","3935":"Open ocean observations have shown that increasing levels of anthropogenically-derived atmospheric CO2 are causing acidification of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s oceans. Yet little is known about coastal acidification and very few studies have characterized the carbonate chemistry of coastal zones or intertidal rock pools where many calcifying organisms exist. In addition to various physical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (D.O.), and salinity), we characterized the carbonate chemistry by taking measurements of pH, total alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of two tide pools (0.41 m3 and 0.10 m3) located at Dead Man\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Cove on San Juan Island, Washington, to determine the extent of variation over the course of one tidal cycle and compared those results to local water samples taken from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Both tidal pools exhibited extreme values in carbonate chemistry over the course of the day (for the 0.41 m3 tide pool: 7.36 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 8.60 pH, 2116.53 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 1669.86 \u0152\u00bamol kg-1 total alkalinity, 2171.5 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 1216.1 \u0152\u00bamol kg-1 DIC, and 2088.494 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 57.448 \u0152\u00baatm pCO2) and calcite and aragonite saturation states (0.623-6.84 \u0152\u00a9 Ca, 0.392-4.388 \u0152\u00a9 Ar). On separate, consecutive days, the alga Ulva sp. and the mussle Mytilus trossulus were added to the smaller of the tide pools to observe the potential impact of photosynthetic versus respiring biomass on the carbonate chemistry. Adding algae resulted in an expected increase in pH, a decrease in DIC, and an increase in \u0152\u00a9 Ca and \u0152\u00a9 Ar. Total alkalinity decreased less than expected; perhaps due to the shading of coralline algae by Ulva which may have prevented coralline calcification. pCO2 decreased less than expected on day 2 relative to day 1 in the treatment pool and may have been due to changes in weather relative to the first day. Addition of mussels resulted in an expected increase in DIC, an increase in pCO2 and reductions in \u0152\u00a9 Ca and \u0152\u00a9 Ar. D.O. did not increase and pH did not decrease as much as expected on day 3 in the treatment pool and these unexpected findings may be due to the fact that mussels were not allowed to acclimate. Excretion of ammonium or addition of organic acids from added mussels may have offset a reduction in total alkalinity. This study demonstrates that many intertidal species are experiencing far greater fluctuations in carbonate chemistry than expected and has significant implications for ocean acidification experiments where intertidal species are used.","3936":"The carbonate chemistry of the San Juan Archipelago is extremely varied between regions of low to high tidal flushing. Salinity seems to be a driving parameter of the carbonate system through its effects on alkalinity. Freshwater from the Fraser River may control the environmental characteristics of water moving through the archipelago. In areas of low flushing, biological effects may strongly influence the carbonate chemistry. The effects of upwelling, especially on the west side are understudied. Overall, the water of the different sounds, channels, and straits of the islands are exchanged and equilibrated by mixing during strong spring tides. It is important to understand the interplay between environmental and biological controllers of carbonate chemistry to interpret changes that may be observed with the advent of ocean acidification.","3937":"The absorption of carbon dioxide into the ocean acidifies the waters and has the potential to drastically alter the chemistry upon which organisms and ecosystems depend. This effect, however, is expected to vary between water masses that already differ in terms of their existing carbonate chemistry. The San Juan Archipelago is an ever-changing, complex estuarine ecosystem with little published literature regarding spatial and temporal variation in its carbonate chemistry. After measuring DIC and TA between the neap and spring tide at nine locations throughout the archipelago, we found that the water differs through space and time \u201a\u00c4\u00ec both throughout the monthly tidal cycle as well as the daily tidal cycle. Measurements for six parameters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec salinity, temperature, DIC, TA, pCO2 and pH \u201a\u00c4\u00ec were analyzed to further understand how areas that experience low, medium and high amounts of flushing over the tidal cycle may differ in their water chemistry. Due to few replicates and insufficient sampling days, we were only able to conclude that the Fraser River, tides and likely biology all impact the carbonate chemistry of the region. We hope that further studies will be conducted in the region to better quantify how well it will withstand increasing ocean acidification.","3938":"Due to the dynamic nature of the water masses in the San Juan archipelago, the carbonate chemistry has not yet been well defined in space and time. For this short-term study during a neap to spring tidal cycle in mid July 2011, we analyzed water samples as far west as Kellett Bluff and as far east as East Sound for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), temperature, and salinity at depths of 10 meters. As expected, we found variability across space and time that may be in part explained by a freshwater signal from the Fraser River, differences in flow and flushing rates, the physical geography and the resultant estuarine and ocean circulation. With continued and more expansive sampling, this data will have pertinence for the larger and future dialogue about ocean acidification in coastal environments.","3939":"This is the first study that characterizes the carbonate parameters in the Salish Sea surrounding the San Juan Archipelago. Water samples were collected from 9 sites on multiple days and analyzed for total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon. Results show high spatial and temporal variability in carbonated parameters. Levels of pCO2 roughly fluctuated between 400 and 950 \u0152\u00baatm. The sites are likely highly influenced by freshwater pulses and tidal exchanges. Stark differences between areas of hypothesized high and low water retention were not observed within this sampling scheme.","3940":"During the low tide, tidepools are under different physio-chemical conditions than the coastal waters. This includes the carbonate chemistry, which is especially pertinent to study due to the threat of ocean acidification on carbonate chemistry. We examined the fluctuation in DIC, total alkalinity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity in two tide pools in Dead Man\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Cove, San Juan Island, WA over the course of the low tide. To better understand the relative contributions of photosynthesizers and respirers to changes in carbonate chemistry, we added Ulva to one pool on the second day, and Mytilus trossulus on the third day. During the low tide, tidepools saw a decrease in DIC and alkalinity, and an increase in pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. There is evidence of a small signal of decrease in DIC due to Ulva addition and increased DIC due to Mytilus addition. Tidepools experience huge swings in carbonate chemistry that suggests an ability of the organisms that inhabit the pools to cope with large changes in pH over the course of the day.","3941":"Characterization of physical conditions in tide pools is quite common in the scientific literature, but there is a marked paucity of information regarding the carbonate chemistry of these ecosystems; the majority of studies focus on temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen measurements. This lack of information is especially worrisome in light of the predicted changes in carbonate chemistry (Ocean Acidification) likely to result from an increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In order to establish a baseline of comparison, we analyzed the carbonate chemistry of two tide pools at Dead Man\u201a\u00c4\u00f2s Cove on San Juan Island, WA. We found marked deviation in carbonate chemistry parameters in the tide pools from the nearby water of Haro Strait. We also attempted to elucidate the underlying causal factors of this deviation by adding biota to the tide pools, yet our results were inconclusive. We conclude that future work should focus on more extensive characterization of natural coastal and intertidal variation in carbonate chemistry parameters, as well as experimental design targeted at determining underlying causal factors of said variation in nature.","3942":"Tide pools are known to have extreme variations in both their temperature and carbonate chemistry while they are isolated from the surrounding waters. These extreme environments provide an interesting view into how organisms are able to cope with large variations in temperature, pH and total carbon. The knowledge of how organisms cope with high temperature and low pH conditions will be beneficial when contemplating how organisms will deal with the conditions that are expected to come from global warming and ocean acidification in the not-too-distant future. In this study we observe several physical and chemical characteristics of two tide pools, comparing them to each other as well as to the waters surrounding them. We then manipulate one of the tide pools (by adding photosynthesizing organisms on one day and respiring organisms on the next day) in order to observe the biological impact on the carbon chemistry of a tide pool.","3943":"Tidepools are a prominent feature of the intertidal zone, housing a great diversity of both macroalgae and mobile animal components. Tidepool organisms are exposed to wide variations in temperature, salinity, and pH over the course of the low tide. As of yet, very few studies have quantified the changes in carbonate chemistry in tidepools. The objective of this study was to quantify the changes in carbonate chemistry in tidepools over the course of three consecutive low tides and to determine if biological additions would alter the degree of change in carbonate parameters occurring over the course of the low tide. The carbonate chemistry in the tidepools we surveyed underwent drastic changes over the course of the low tide. With increasing isolation time, the total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon decreased, and the pH increased. However, no signal from the addition of Ulva sp. or Mytilus trossulus was detected in this study.","3944":"Two different experimental systems were used to evaluate sources of error in carbonate chemistry measurements at Friday Harbor Labs, WA. One system, set up in Laboratory 6, examined the effects of different filters and a UV sterilizer. The second system explored the carbon input from feeding live versus dead algae in the presence of mussels, Mytilus trossulus. The use of an activated charcoal filter and UV sterilizer increased the pH of incoming seawater more than that of a pleated sediment filter and UV sterilizer. There were no discernable changes in the Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), and no trends could be seen in Total Alkalinity. Feeding live or dead algae produced similar results over most carbonate measurements. All treatments decreased treatment tank pH, increased tank pCO2, and increased tank DIC. However, feeding dead algae notably decreased treatment tank Total Alkalinity, while mussels that were fed live food did not show a difference in this parameter when compared to non-treated water.","3945":"Since 2005, one site has been studied in the San Juan Channel, located just off San Juan Island, Washington in the United States. This research has been done by the Pelagic Ecosystem Function Apprenticeship at the Friday Harbor Labs on San Juan Island. Continuing this research and focusing on mammals in the San Juan Channel, individual mammal species were counted in autumn 2011. 2011 abundances were calculated based on these counts, compared to abundances from 2007-2010, and looked at by date of sailing, zone in the study, and tidal phase present during each sailing in each zone. The zones were predetermined by the apprenticeship. Mammal individuals were counted using visual identification taken on day trips in October and November 2011. All mammal species seen across the study site, or transect , were counted during these sailings. The four mammals seen in the San Juan Channel in 2011 were Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina), Steller Sea Lions (Eumatopias jubatus), Harbor Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Poropoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Abundance for Harbor Seals was higher in 2010 and 2011 compared to years 2007-2009. Abundance for Harbor Porpoise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s in 2011 was significantly higher than years 2007 to 2010. Abundance for Steller Sea Lions and Dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Porpoise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remained stable from 2007-2011. Harbor Seals were the most abundant mammal present in the study, and Dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Porpoise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s were the least abundant. For the pinniped species, Harbor Seals and Steller Sea Lions showed no net change across season, but showed variation date to date. By zone, Harbor Seals showed some preference for Zone 3 in the study, and Steller Sea Lions showed high preference for Zone 5. By tidal phase, Harbor Seals and Steller Sea Lions both showed 3 preferences that differed in each zone. Abundance in relation to date, zone, and tidal phase for both species are likely effected by two factors; the location of haul out sites, as well as presence of prey.","3946":"The San Juan Channel is a transitional area between marine and freshwater environments that influences the distribution, abundance and community composition of zooplankton. Zooplankton communities are highly variable seasonally and interannually due to the complexity of physical oceanography in the region. During the fall season in 2011, tidal regimes that characterize this estuarine environment appeared to spatially influence highly abundant Calanoid copepods and copepod nauplii. The results of this study suggest that tidal forcing exhibits a significant influence Calanoid copepods and copepod nauplii in the San Juan Channel, where spring flood tides influenced the Northern region and neap flood tides influenced the Southern region at depth. Spatial variation in the distribution of juvenile and adult copepods between these regions may be explained by behavioral patterns in copepod diapause, while depth variation in the Southern region may be driven by behavioral patterns in diel vertical migration. These investigations may begin to enhance our understanding of the relative life history stages of copepods as an influence on their distribution and abundance in the San Juan Channel.","3947":"The purpose of study was to investigate how physical and biological factors influence phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen spatially and temporally in San Juan Channel over fall and the annual cycle of 2011. Specific objectives were to 1) Spatially assess differences in the phytoplankton community by analyzing genera abundance over fall 2011 at North and South stations and compare spatial patterns with those found in chlorophyll, 2) temporally evaluate the correlation between chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen levels during fall 2011 at high resolution to infer whether phytoplankton, as indicated by chlorophyll, influences dissolved oxygen more than physical factors and 3) repeat the second analysis over the 2011 annual cycle. Phytoplankton genera in the San Juan Channel were consistently similar across stations and weekly cruises for fall 2011. Differences in phytoplankton genera were a result of single-species dominated periods. Phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll concentrations were found to decrease as the season progressed to winter, consistent with previous studies. Physical factors dominated the influence on dissolved oxygen both spatially, across North and South stations, and temporally throughout the year with the exception of July. In July, biological factors appeared to be equivalent to physical factors in influencing dissolved oxygen, as a result of high summer productivity.","3948":"The San Juan Archipelago is ecologically important to numerous marine bird species. The Pelagic Ecosystem Function Apprenticeship has conducted Fall surveys in this area since 2006. This study took place in the San Juan Channel. It evaluates the abundance and community composition of marine bird populations in October and November of 2011. The most dominant families, Alcids and Gulls, were assessed. Species with the highest abundance were ranked over the last six years. Overall, the data does not display evidence of decline; stable abundance and community composition have been established. This is in opposition to other studies, which show general declines across marine bird populations over the last 40 years. However, long-term relationships have yet to be established in the San Juan Channel.","3949":"The San Juan Channel is one passageway linking the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Thus, the physical oceanography of this region is complex and has both estuarine and oceanic influences. We sampled a 5-station transect along the San Juan Channel during fall 2011 as part of a multi-annual study started in 2004 and a monthly study started in early 2011. We deployed a CTD to gather information on temperature, salinity, and density structure in the water column. Temperature followed an annual cycle with cooling in the winter and warming in the summer, while haloclines were more tidally modulated. Short-term along-channel density structure was controlled by both tides and wind. Density stratification increased at the south end increased during flood tides, and at the north end and mid-channel during ebb tides. The depth and width of the pycnocline at the southern end of the channel were correlated to tidal height. These findings enhance our understanding of both short-term and long-term patterns in density gradients of the San Juan Channel pelagic environment.","3950":"Many current models predicting the effects of climate change assume species are homogenous across geographic distribution and life stage. However local adaptations may result in variable impacts of climate change across isolated populations. Furthermore, individuals of different life stages may exhibit different tolerances to variations in climatic conditions. We use the widely distributed tide pool copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model organism to test differences in thermal tolerance across populations and life stage of broadly distributed species. We tested the thermal tolerance of seven populations (spanning 15\u00ac\u221e in latitude) from the northern extent of the species range. We found that thermal tolerance differed among populations and life stage. However the degree of differentiation between populations was less pronounced in these northern populations than previously observed in southern populations. This is likely due to significantly less interpopulation mtDNA differentiation in the northern extent of the range than in the southern.","3951":"Species living over large geographical ranges often have populations that are better adapted their local conditions (Helmuth et al. 2002). For example, populations of the splash-pool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, can tolerate higher temperatures as latitude decreases (Willett 2010). Studies on many organisms, including copepods, tend to look at a large geographical range and make generalizations about the thermal tolerance homogeneity of populations in specific latitude. By doing this we ignore possible effects of changing climate on some populations of copepods in areas that geographically are considered more tolerant. This study demonstrates a significant difference in the lethal temperature tolerance between two populations 30 kilometers apart on San Juan Island, WA. These sites are relatively close together compared to other studies. If we know that geographically close populations may be affected differently by climate change, then we may be more specific and cautious with our predictive modeling, not treating all populations the same.","3952":"The San Juan Islands of Washington State are a unique habitat for both humans and wildlife. Although they are in close proximity to the urban cities of Seattle and Tacoma, these islands remain relatively rural and have maintained close connections to wildlife. I will be working with Wolf Hollow Rehabilitation Center in Friday Harbor, WA on San Juan Island to evaluate human interactions and attitudes regarding wildlife. Within this study I will examine the major causes of injury and harm to wildlife as well as the differences of actions and attitudes towards terrestrial and marine wildlife. Based on these results, the educational tools employed by Wolf Hollow will be analyzed in order to see if they are effectively targeting certain gaps in human knowledge about wildlife.","3953":"Pacific sand lances, Ammodytes personatus, are nutrient dense forage fish important to salmon recovery and orca conservation in the San Juan archipelago. Sand lances burrow into sandy sediments during quiescence and in response to threats. Ammodytes spp. choose habitats with specific sizes of sediment particles, but the biological reasons for their preferences are poorly understood. Burrowing force in different sediments is measured using resin models of sand lance and a materials testing system. The final testing methods are validated by first varying the volume of sediment, mixing procedure, and speed. Laboratory limitations do not preclude comparison with in-vivo activity. There is a non-linear relationship between force and grain size. In general, coarser sediments are more difficult to penetrate. When the scales were removed, models more easily penetrated the sediment, but produced a similar non-linear trend. Burrowing forces are correlated with observed habitat preferences, and may be useful in habitat predictions.","3954":"Teeth are important in the breakdown and digestion of food. They are oftentimes a good indicator of an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fitness and survival. Though many have studied durophagous tooth morphologies and prey preference, no study has aimed to understand how crushing teeth work, and if there are prey-specific specializations. To understand tooth-prey interactions, we made two different aluminum tooth models: pointy and cup- shaped. Then, measured the force required by the teeth to initially break plaster snail and mussel shells produced by a 3-D printer. Assuming that the durophagous predator is able to consume its prey after an initial breakage, our results suggest that pointy teeth are more effective at crushing snail shells. However, neither tooth morphology is more effective in crushing mussel shells.","3955":"As global biodiversity continues to decline greater attention is being paid on ways law can be a mechanism to advance conservator efforts. Currently, southern resident killer whales are listed as \u201a\u00c4\u00f2endangered\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 under the endangered species act. Comprising a population of 88 individuals it has been shown that disturbance by vessels may affect key behaviors and mask echolocation, which is critical for foraging and communication. Within the Puget Sound, Southern Residents are exposed routinely to commercial whale watching, and vessel interaction has been listed as a contributing factor to their endangered status. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration implemented federal vessel regulations in April 2011 with include a no parking in the path of whales\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 restriction and a 200-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eayard buffer between vessels and whales. Within May through September 2011 Soundwatch collected data pertaining to the number of vessels, the types of these vessels, and any observed incidents. What was found that on average 12 boats surround this population on a daily basis, with a maximum of 62 boats. These boats mostly comprise of commercial whale watching operations with 6 boats on average. Of the 2,500 incidents that were private boaters committed 58%, followed by the commercial industry with 21%. The top incidents that were committed were being within 200 yards and 100 yards of the whales, and being inshore of whales. As NOAA seeks to revise and enforce these federal regulations it is imperative to have accurate and consistent monitoring on the water.","3956":"Teeth are the interface between an organism and its prey, and can be used to infer an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s diet. However, little is known the interactions between tooth morphology and prey items in durophagous systems. To begin to investigate these interactions, we tested the force required by two tooth morphologies, one cupped and one pointed, to break model snail and mussel shells. We believed that the cupped tooth would best crush the snail shell, and the pointed tooth would best break the mussel shell. The pointed tooth was found to crush the snail shell at a lower force, while for the mussel shells there was no difference in crushing forces between tooth morphologies. Further study is needed to fully appreciate the interactions between tooth and prey morphologies, especially to be able to accurately predict an organisms\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 diet based on tooth shape.","3957":"Relationships between shell thickness and predation techniques have been established; however, it has not yet been determined if a relationship exists between shell length and predation technique. Crabs often use a variety of techniques while trying to access their prey. Our study examines whether handling times and methods used to break open snail shells vary by shell length. We tested the red rock crab Cancer productus with various species and sizes of snails and observed methods used to access the snail\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flesh, timing each interaction. Total handling time increased exponentially with an increase in shell size. Larger snails were predominantly chipped at the aperture, while smaller snails were crushed outright. Crabs would occasionally break off the snail\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s apex; however, this was rare. The results of this study may be used as a baseline for ocean acidification studies and also gives us a model for future behavioral studies related to predation.","3958":"Invasions of nonnative species are a major problem for environments around the world, and interest in restoring the rare prairie ecosystem in Washington has been growing since the 1980s. The majority of the research in this field addresses the methods of restoration. To gain a better understanding of the process, I looked at how restoration of the native prairie remnant was being carried out at a national park in Washington and what major challenges were associated with it. I found through working with park staff and conducting interviews that, although there were significant challenges posed by eliminating nonnative species and preparing the land for seeding native plants, the major barrier to the restoration in this case was the public opposition to the project. In part, the former park superintendent had handled the conflict poorly, but I also discovered that much controversy surrounded this restoration project, especially for the public, regarding four main issues of debate: controlling the nonnative European rabbit, applying herbicides, whether the prairie should be restored at all, and what point it should be restored to. My findings point to the need for greater research regarding the social side of the issue, as it can present a significant obstacle to restoration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s success.","3959":"The Friday Harbor Marina water quality project incorporates 5th grade educational outreach and the scientific testing of how anthropogenic development can increase concentrations of fecal pollution in the Friday Harbor Marina. Learning how outreach efforts are changing 5th graders\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attitudes towards science may help revise future outreach projects. Additionally, understanding how development in Friday Harbor is influencing the health of the marina can target pollution management to highly-impacted areas. An attitudinal before and after survey was administered to test if students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 scientific interests changed while testing six sites within the marina for fecal coliform contamination. Predictions concerning the increase in student attitudes were unfounded because before and after survey results were not statistically different. Fecal coliform levels were highest near sites of non-point and point source pollution, which corresponds with predictions about the degradation of water quality from development.","3960":"Climate change will alter life on Earth, but the specific impact on any given species is less certain. Most current forecasting models lump all members of a species under one climatic envelope, thus ignoring the possibility of local adaptation among isolated populations of a wide-ranging species to result in differing climatic needs for each population compared to the species as a whole. To provide experimental evidence of the importance of local adaptation, we test each life stage of seven populations of copepod Tigriopus californicus ranging fifteen degrees in latitude, expecting populations and possibly life stages to differ in thermal tolerance. Our results show populations living in cooler climates generally have a lower thermal tolerance, and also juveniles exhibit higher thermal tolerances than adults, which could affect how a population responds to changing conditions. Thus, it is important for models to consider the roles of adaptation and evolution in species survival.","3961":"Farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 markets are exploding in numbers all over the country in recent years due to an increased demand to reclaim the right to know who grows food and what it contains. While many studies exist to address this growing trend in farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 markets, most research centers on how consumer demographics and behaviors limit the success or failure of a market. This study fills in for the lack of focus on farmers and the detailed process of how they drive a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market into being. Through semi-structured interviews with 14 farmers in the San Juan county region, this study seeks to address the challenges that occur during the establishment of a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market. Analysis of these interviews yields many varied answers to these two questions: 1) what is the purpose of a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market according to farmers and 2) what obstacles do farmers face when establishing a market? The history these farmers tell helps understand how a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market can become a thriving infrastructure for small farmers in a rural town. This case study will contribute to a body of research that analyzes market histories to create better models for future market communities.","3962":"I looked at the effects of substrate angle on species assemblages across a gradient from horizontal to vertical. In doing so I categorized the sloping gradient of six bins of 15\u00ac\u221e, and analyzed photographic quadrats placing them into one of these six categories. Additionally I analyzed these quadrats for percent cover down to the lowest taxonomic level. I took this a step farther and grouped these into phyla and \u201a\u00c4\u00faspace available\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, I did this to further tease apart possible relationships between substrate angle and percent cover across species. Looking at past literature I discussed how substrate angle has only looked at horizontal versus vertical substrate angles, while neglecting the gradient between these two extremes. Using statistical analyses I was able to determine possible extensions to this study, as well as limitations in drawing conclusions from the collected data.","3963":"Previous studies have demonstrated that regional variation in community structure is largely driven by abiotic factors, but that these factors have less influence on community structure at smaller scales. We sought to investigate the potential role of select abiotic factors in regulating benthic communities at spatial scales ranging from 10 to 1000 meters. This was accomplished by comparing benthic point-intercept survey data against measurements of depth, slope, aspect and current flow. Results indicated that substrate depth and slope significantly correlated with observed differences in community composition, while current flow was marginally correlated with community composition. These results suggest that abiotic factors still play an important role in the structuring of biological communities at local scales.","3964":"Anecdotal evidence has suggested in the past that the Pacific Sand Lance, Ammodytes hexapterus is present every other year in the San Juan Archipelago. This study found the fish to be present in the San Juans, as they were last year, but not as abundant as in previous years sampling. As in numerous past studies, the A. hexapterus was found to preferentially burrow in medium to coarse-grained sand and avoid sediments higher in fine particles. General trends in tidal current speeds and the abundance of sand lance in the sediment were observed. Higher levels of fish was found in the sand when tidal currents slowed from ebb to slack.","3965":"There are many factors contributing to the composition of biological communities in coastal marine habitats worldwide. Operating over large regional spatial scales, abiotic variables such as temperature and oceanic current patterns have been shown to form patchy, complex distributions of organisms. At much smaller local scales, inter- and intraspecific interactions such as competition for resources and space as well as predation pressures have been shown to structure the distribution of organisms. For this study, seven study sites were selected in close proximity to the UW Friday Harbor Laboratories to investigate the contributions of select abiotic factors (depth, slope, aspect, and flow rates) on community compositions at small spatial scales. Ordination of sample groups by non-parametric MDS and ANOSIM analysis using percent cover data showed significant differences in community composition across all depths (Global R= 0.561, p=0.001) with a distinct transition at the 50fsw depth (Global R=0.702, p=0.001). MDS ordination and one-way ANOSIM analysis of the horizontally and vertically oriented transects in the shallow and deep depths showed significant differences between these orientation classifications (R=0.17, p=0.025; R=0.359, p=0.001, respectively). MDS and ANOSIM analysis of the GIS-derived slope classifications in the shallow and deep depths showed no significant differences between the slope classifications (R=0.065, p=0.618; R=0.037, p=0.354, respectively). MDS and ANOSIM analysis of the GIS-derived aspect classifications in the shallow and deep depths showed no significant differences between the aspect classifications (R=0.054, p=0.292; R=0.108, p=0.204, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, no published studies to date have assessed the influence of the aspect of a habitat to community structure, either qualitatively or quantitatively. Studying the small-scale effects of these abiotic factors, accompanied with studies of biotic factors regulating community composition, provide a more complete assessment of coastal ecosystems and can enhance conservation and management of these important habitats.","3966":"East Sound and West Sound, Orcas Island WA, are two glacially cut fjords dominated by mud and silty\/mud substrates (Endris et. al., 2010). Fine grained substrates are typically dominated by deposit feeding organisms, specifically polychaetes (Lenihan and Micheli, 2001). Estuaries, with influx of fine grained material and alteration of water chemistry, exhibit lower overall diversity (Constable, 1999). This study aims to evaluate differences in the infaunal macroinvertebrate communities in East and West Sound Orcas Island Washington State. A possible controlling factor on the communities within East Sound is a glacially deposited partial sill at the mouth that restricts flow and likely creates differing physical conditions from West Sound. This question is addressed by 1) collecting and characterizing the infaunal macroinvertebrates within East and West Sound. 2) Measuring physical parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and grain size distribution. 3) Using multibeam backscatter data and in-situ sampling to delineate the boundaries between different communities in the two sounds.","3967":"My research will seek to look at how fluid flow might determine the distribution of Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, to determine where it can be found in microhabitats of the San Juan Channel based on fluid velocity measurements at several sites. To evaluate relative flow speeds around the San Juan Channel we deployed uniform blocks of alabaster (Muus, 1968; Doty 1971; Eckman et. al., 1989), a soft stone, and measured dissolution rates over the course of a month long tidal cycle","3968":"Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) inhabit subtidal sediment wave fields in the San Juan Islands of Washington state. Although they are an important forage fish, serving as a trophic link between zooplankton and larger organisms, very little is known of the life history of subtidal sand lance in the sediment wave fields. Here, I hypothesize that spatial and temporal patterns of sand lance abundance are influenced by a variety of physical factors, including sediment grain size and tidal currents. Using a Van Veen grab sampler to collect sand lance in the sediment fields, and an ADP to measure current velocities over two, 3 hour sampling periods aboard the R\/V Centennial, I found anomalously high numbers of sand lance in the sediment during slack before flood tides when northward velocities measured between +\/- 15 cm s-1. In contrast, negative anomalies that occurred during weak ebb tides of -20 to -40 cm s-1. This suggests fine scale temporal variation in sand lance presence in the sediment fields may be tied to tidal cycles, and that sand lance may enter and leave the fields during the fall and early winter. The sediment fields near Sucia Island composed of large (1mm) shell hash, contained only mature fish, while the finer grained (1\/2 mm) sediments of the San Jean Channel wave field had larger proportions of juveniles less than 90 mm in length, suggesting a relationship between sediment grain size and life stage. Other factors including depth and tidal mixing may also play a role in the spatial distribution of sand lance.","3969":"Understanding benthic community distributions, and using such information in marine restoration ecology, requires an understanding of the effect of substrate angle on assembly patterns. To date, there is no information regarding in situ identification and remote identification of sessile benthic invertebrate assemblages on substrate angles from 0\u00ac\u221e to 90\u00ac\u221e. This study aimed to document the effect of substrate angle on sessile invertebrate assemblages and to both develop and validate an approach for remotely identifying assemblages based on substrate angle. The in situ photoquadrat method was used to document invertebrate assemblages at five 15 m deep sites in the San Juan Channel. Substrate angle was recorded for each photo based on six 15\u00ac\u221e categories. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses suggested that there are three distinct assemblages of invertebrates: horizontal (0-15\u00ac\u221e), sloping (15-75\u00ac\u221e), vertical (75-90\u00ac\u221e). Crustose coralline algae, non-calcified (maroon) encrusting red algae, encrusting bryozoans, tube complex (amphipods, polychaetes), and porifera contributed more than 5% to assemblage differences due to angle at all sites. These results necessitate a review of factors thought to cause differences in assemblages due to substrate angle. The relationship between species and substrate angle was applied to multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry data, gridded at 2 m, in ArcGISTM. Transect locations were plotted and ArcGIS generated slope values. ArcGIS scale was smaller than the photoquadrat scale; therefore, the scales were not comparable. This technique for remotely identifying assemblages based on substrate angle may be utilized in the future by following a revised protocol that includes the collection of bathymetric and photoquadrat data at the similar Paxton, 3 scales. This approach may be used both in the San Juan Channel and internationally for restoration and long-term monitoring efforts.","3970":"The influence of a refuge on escape responses was observed on Staghorn sculpins (Leptocottus armatus; Girard, 1854). The refuge was offered in sequences to compose four treatments to test if fish showed different behavioral responses. The locomotor performance to mechanical stimulation was observed by the use of high speed video tracking. There was no significant difference in velocity and acceleration between each treatment, except when responses were sorted in short and long latencies. To eliminate the possibility that the stimulus did not induce an escape response, angular velocities in startled fish were compared with the turning rate in routine swimming. This study showed that the presence of a refuge had an impact on the fish trajectories in the treatment where fish were orientated towards the refuge. As it was only in the treatment mentioned above a difference in trajectory was found after stage 2,a final trajectory at point F was used. In treatments where fish had the refuge behind them or where the stimulus hit the water, analysis of trajectories at point F showed a tendency that fish changed direction after a fast start towards the refuge. This may show that mauthner neuron induced responses were only towards a refuge if it was visually mediated in advantageous positions.","3971":"Swimming represents the primary means through which fishes interact with their environment, and factors influencing swimming performance can profoundly affect their distribution and survivorship. Traditional measures of swimming performance are estimated under laboratory conditions using steady water flow. However, these experiments potentially underestimate the actual cost of swimming under unsteady water flows that characterize natural systems. Using a swimming respirometer and video recordings, we swam Cymatogaster aggregata using a standard Ucrit swimming trial under one of three flow conditions with the same mean water velocity at each speed increment: steady flow (control), low amplitude water velocity fluctuations ( A=0.5BLs-1) and high amplitude water velocity fluctuations (A=1BLs-1). We found that unsteady flows increase the metabolic cost of swimming, but only when high flows push a swimming fish beyond the threshold for exclusively aerobic metabolism (beyond Uburst). Furthermore, unsteady flows at the highest amplitude treatment decreased the maximum mean velocity (Ucrit) and mean gait transition velocity (Upc) achieved by individuals compared to the control and low amplitude unsteady flows. However, lower costs of swimming than predicted in low amplitude flows below Uburst suggest that fish are able to take advantage of the cyclical wave patterns and economize energy expenditure. Mean pectoral fin beat frequency did not differ significantly among treatments. This is the first study exploring the costs of swimming under unsteady flow in a marine labriform swimmer.","3972":"Lateralization of cognitive functions seems to be exceptionally widespread in nature and have been demonstrated to occur in multiple taxa. Previous studies using fish as models have suggested that social behaviours such as schooling may covary with behavioural lateralization at the population-level. Here, we assess the strength, degree and repeatability of behavioural lateralization in schooling fish. Two of the species studied (Aulorhynchus flavidus and Gasterosteus aculeatus) were found to express population-level symmetry in the direction of lateralization whereas one species (Ammodytes hexapterus) showed no indication of population-level lateralization. We also provide evidence that behavioral lateralization is repeatable over time. From our cross-species comparisons we conclude that population-level lateralization is not necessarily related to a gregarious life-style. Further studies should test repeatability over longer periods of time and the role of lateralization in schooling behavior.","3973":"Intraspecific variation in swimming performance, morphology and escape responses was assessed in the labriform shiner perch, Cymatogaster aggregata. Shiner perch were videotaped while swimming in a respirometer during a critical swimming speed (Ucrit) protocol. The degree of individual variation in both oxygen consumption rate (\u00b7\u03c0\u00c4O2) and kinematic performance was evaluated from this Ucrit challenge. Fast escape performance was also evaluated in the same group of fish. There was an approximately two-fold variation in metabolic rate of fish swimming at 0.5 body lengths per second (MR@0.5 bl s-1) and active metabolic rate, aerobic scope for swimming and critical swimming speed. A significant correlation was found between active metabolic rate and aerobic scope and between MR@0.5 bl s-1 and aerobic scope. Similarly there was a significant relationship between active metabolic rate and Ucrit. Individual variation in swimming performance could not be explained by differences in morphology of the caudal or pectoral fins or variation in body shape or size. There were no significant relationships between stage of escape response completed and any metabolic variables indicating that anaerobic escape responses are independent of aerobic capacity of the fish.","3974":"While the use of accelerometers in the aquatic environment becomes an increasingly used tool in remotely observing animals; however, the data obtained from deploying accelerometers still needs better understanding. Observations gathered by studies using accelerometers are largely limited to the identification of simple behaviours such as resting and swimming, yet fine-scale movements such as feeding and escape responses are mostly undetected. In this experiment, we aim to establish a link between acceleration traces and fast-start movements in the Great Sculpin (M. polyacanthocephalus) by the analysis of acceleration data from accelerometers and a high-speed video camera. Feeding events, escape events and spontaneous movements were triggered and observed using a 100Hz recording accelerometer (Little Leonardo Ltd, Japan) and a high-speed video camera for n = 7 great sculpin. Kinematic comparison between acceleration obtained from accelerometers and high-speed video camera were performed using vector transformation, yet prove to be difficult due to differences in reference frames and different sources of error. To establish a link between behaviour and acceleration, statistical analysis shows that the signature of spontaneous events can be described by the variation of the magnitude of acceleration which is significantly lower in spontaneous events compared to fast-start movements. Most of this information is lost (50%) if the accelerometer sampling rate is lower than 30Hz. Furthermore, two parameters (the value of Amax the variation of acceleration in lateral and forward direction) allow us to differentiate between escape events and feeding events. These results are a valuable contribution to understanding acceleration data in the field and the issues associated with low sampling rates.","3975":"The coarse Elwha River Delta is now exposed to an influx of fine-grained sediment from the removal of two dams. The coarse substrate of the delta and energetic oceanographic processes will result in complicated sediment deposition patterns. This study used grain-size distribution and water velocity data compared with prior studies to conclude where change in the delta substrate has occurred and under what conditions deposition is likely to occur. Grab samples and video footage were used to map the substrate and a shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler was used to measure water velocity and subsequently to estimate bed shear velocity. Currents west of the river were on average lower then on the east suggesting deposition is likely to occur on the west side. Deposition of fine sediment was found west of the river while the seabed east of the river has remained coarse. Deposition of sand is likely to occur during periods of low shear velocities during ebb and slack tides. This study provided background work for future research on the oceanographic processes that allow deposition on the west side of the river.","3976":"The largest dam removal project in U.S. history began on the Elwha River in 2011. A large quantity of sediment was expected to enter the marine environment, but where this sediment would end up and how it would get there were unknown. This study investigated currents and sediment transport at a study site offshore of the Elwha Delta over two winters during the dam removal process. Trends between Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data and oceanographic conditions were examined. Suspended sediment concentrations at the study site were obtained by calibrating ADCP backscatter data, and were found to be most strongly correlated with river discharge. These data indicated that advection was the primary mechanism of sediment transport at the study site. Currents were found to be predominantly eastward, indicating the direction of advection. This study provides a foundation for future work examining the transportation of sediment in and around the Elwha Delta, and how this transport will impact the area in the future.","3977":"Marine soft-sediments comprise the largest and oldest habitat types on earth (Gray 1974). Species and communities within these habitats vary spatially and temporally; controlled by sediment composition, disturbance, primary production, and biotic interactions (Lenihan and Micheli, 2001). These variations can occur over a matter of meters and result in highly patchy sea floors (Snelgrove and Butman, 1994). A relationship between grain-size and faunal diversity was first identified by Peterson (1913) and further investigated by Johnson (1957) becoming a widely accepted supposition until the 90's (Snelgrove and Butman, 1994). Snelgrove and Butman\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s (1994) review of animal-sediment relationships noted no consistent relationship in the literature between fauna and grain size and questioned if other mechanisms are driving the apparent relationship.\n \n Gray (2002) maintains the animal-sediment relationship and argues that many results cannot be considered characteristic of soft-sediment communities as a whole because most studies are small in spatial and temporal scale and lack extensive sampling. Regional scale diversity controls local species richness and environmental factors in turn determine regional richness. Environmental factors are grain-size diversity, temperature, and productivity. Gray (2002) further postulates that reduced richness may be the result of geologic history such as the Pleistocene glaciation of high latitudes. Benthic animals may not have had the time needed to fully colonize or establish stable communities in environs bound up or scraped clean by ice. Both reviews agree that further sampling controlling for a number of biologically relevant physical factors, including sediment grain size, need to be performed over larger temporal and spatial scales (Snelgrove and Butman, 1994; Lenihan and Micheli, 2001; Gray 2002).","3978":"The Salish Sea of Washington State, USA and British Columbia, Canada is characterized by deep narrow channels with saltwater input from the Pacific Ocean and freshwater input from the Frasier River. The San Juan archipelago sits right at the intersection of these two inputs. This region experiences mixed semidiurnal tides and has many narrow passes and abrupt sills that characterize local flow dynamics. A steep drop off close to shore typifies the bathymetry of the sub-tidal habitat. Some of the more obvious parameters that control where benthic sub-tidal organisms live are light and availability of food, but a few studies have sought to shed some light on how microhabitats created by flow regimes also are an important consideration. Small scale studies on how flow affects benthic communities have shown pieces of how communities and individual species of benthic filter feeders have the highest performance when they are within their target flow range. This range is determined mainly by the physiology of how organisms feed.","3979":"Previous studies have demonstrated that regional variation in community structure is largely driven by abiotic factors, but that these factors have less influence on community structure at smaller scales. We sought to investigate the potential role of select abiotic factors in regulating benthic communities at spatial scales ranging from 10 to 1000 meters. This was accomplished by comparing benthic point-intercept survey data against measurements of depth, slope, aspect and current flow. Results indicated that substrate depth and slope significantly correlated with observed differences in community composition, while current flow was marginally correlated with community composition. These results suggest that abiotic factors still play an important role in the structuring of biological communities at local scales.","3980":"I looked at the effects of substrate angle on species assemblages across a gradient from horizontal to vertical. In doing so I categorized the sloping gradient of six bins of 15\u00ac\u221e, and analyzed photographic quadrats placing them into one of these six categories. Additionally I analyzed these quadrats for percent cover down to the lowest taxonomic level. I took this a step farther and grouped these into phyla and \u201a\u00c4\u00faspace available\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, I did this to further tease apart possible relationships between substrate angle and percent cover across species. Looking at past literature I discussed how substrate angle has only looked at horizontal versus vertical substrate angles, while neglecting the gradient between these two extremes. Using statistical analyses I was able to determine possible extensions to this study, as well as limitations in drawing conclusions from the collected data.","3981":"Understanding benthic community distributions, and using such information in marine restoration ecology, requires an understanding of the effect of substrate angle on assembly patterns. To date, there is no information regarding in situ identification and remote identification of sessile benthic invertebrate assemblages on substrate angles from 0\u00ac\u221e to 90\u00ac\u221e. This study aimed to document the effect of substrate angle on sessile invertebrate assemblages and to both develop and validate an approach for remotely identifying assemblages based on substrate angle. The in situ photoquadrat method was used to document invertebrate assemblages at five 15 m deep sites in the San Juan Channel. Substrate angle was recorded for each photo based on six 15\u00ac\u221e categories. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses suggested that there are three distinct assemblages of invertebrates: horizontal (0-15\u00ac\u221e), sloping (15-75\u00ac\u221e), vertical (75-90\u00ac\u221e). Crustose coralline algae, non-calcified (maroon) encrusting red algae, encrusting bryozoans, tube complex (amphipods, polychaetes), and porifera contributed more than 5% to assemblage differences due to angle at all sites. These results necessitate a review of factors thought to cause differences in assemblages due to substrate angle. The relationship between species and substrate angle was applied to multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry data, gridded at 2 m, in ArcGISTM. Transect locations were plotted and ArcGIS generated slope values. ArcGIS scale was smaller than the photoquadrat scale; therefore, the scales were not comparable. This technique for remotely identifying assemblages based on substrate angle may be utilized in the future by following a revised protocol that includes the collection of bathymetric and photoquadrat data at the similar Paxton, 2 scales. This approach may be used both in the San Juan Channel and internationally for restoration and long-term monitoring efforts.","3982":"Understanding benthic community distributions, and using such information in marine restoration ecology, requires an understanding of the effect of substrate angle on assembly patterns.

This study found the fish to be present in the San Juans, as they were last year, but not as abundant as in previous years sampling. As in numerous past studies, the A. hexapterus was found to preferentially burrow in medium to coarse-grained sand and avoid sediments higher in fine particles. General trends in tidal current speeds and the abundance of sand lance in the sediment were observed. Higher levels of fish was found in the sand when tidal currents slowed from ebb to slack.","3985":"Many current models predicting the effects of climate change assume species are homogenous across geographic distribution and life stage. However local adaptations may result in variable impacts of climate change across isolated populations. Furthermore, individuals of different life stages may exhibit different tolerances to variations in climatic conditions. We use the widely distributed tide pool copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model organism to test differences in thermal tolerance across populations and life stage of broadly distributed species. We tested the thermal tolerance of seven populations (spanning 15\u00ac\u221e in latitude) from the northern extent of the species range. We found that thermal tolerance differed among populations and life stage. However the degree of differentiation between populations was less pronounced in these northern populations than previously observed in southern populations. This is likely due to significantly less interpopulation mtDNA differentiation in the northern extent of the range than in the southern.","3986":"Invasions of nonnative species are a major problem for environments around the world, and interest in restoring the rare prairie ecosystem in Washington has been growing since the 1980s. The majority of the research in this field addresses the methods of restoration. To gain a better understanding of the process, I looked at how restoration of the native prairie remnant was being carried out at a national park in Washington and what major challenges were associated with it. I found through working with park staff and conducting interviews that, although there were significant challenges posed by eliminating nonnative species and preparing the land for seeding native plants, the major barrier to the restoration in this case was the public opposition to the project. In part, the former park superintendent had handled the conflict poorly, but I also discovered that much controversy surrounded this restoration project, especially for the public, regarding four main issues of debate: controlling the nonnative European rabbit, applying herbicides, whether the prairie should be restored at all, and what point it should be restored to. My findings point to the need for greater research regarding the social side of the issue, as it can present a significant obstacle to restoration\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s success.","3987":"Farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 markets are exploding in numbers all over the country in recent years due to an increased demand to reclaim the right to know who grows food and what it contains. While many studies exist to address this growing trend in farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 markets, most research centers on how consumer demographics and behaviors limit the success or failure of a market. This study fills in for the lack of focus on farmers and the detailed process of how they drive a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market into being. Through semi-structured interviews with 14 farmers in the San Juan county region, this study seeks to address the challenges that occur during the establishment of a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market. Analysis of these interviews yields many varied answers to these two questions: 1) what is the purpose of a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market according to farmers and 2) what obstacles do farmers face when establishing a market? The history these farmers tell helps understand how a farmers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 market can become a thriving infrastructure for small farmers in a rural town. This case study will contribute to a body of research that analyzes market histories to create better models for future market communities.","3988":"Species living over large geographical ranges often have populations that are better adapted their local conditions (Helmuth et al. 2002). For example, populations of the splash-pool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, can tolerate higher temperatures as latitude decreases (Willett 2010). Studies on many organisms, including copepods, tend to look at a large geographical range and make generalizations about the thermal tolerance homogeneity of populations in specific latitude. By doing this we ignore possible effects of changing climate on some populations of copepods in areas that geographically are considered more tolerant. This study demonstrates a significant difference in the lethal temperature tolerance between two populations 30 kilometers apart on San Juan Island, WA. These sites are relatively close together compared to other studies. If we know that geographically close populations may be affected differently by climate change, then we may be more specific and cautious with our predictive modeling, not treating all populations the same.","3989":"Pacific sand lances, Ammodytes personatus, are nutrient dense forage fish important to salmon recovery and orca conservation in the San Juan archipelago. Sand lances burrow into sandy sediments during quiescence and in response to threats. Ammodytes spp. choose habitats with specific sizes of sediment particles, but the biological reasons for their preferences are poorly understood. Burrowing force in different sediments is measured using resin models of sand lance and a materials testing system. The final testing methods are validated by first varying the volume of sediment, mixing procedure, and speed. Laboratory limitations do not preclude comparison with in-vivo activity. There is a non-linear relationship between force and grain size. In general, coarser sediments are more difficult to penetrate. When the scales were removed, models more easily penetrated the sediment, but produced a similar non-linear trend. Burrowing forces are correlated with observed habitat preferences, and may be useful in habitat predictions.","3990":"Teeth are the interface between an organism and its prey, and can be used to infer an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s diet. However, little is known the interactions between tooth morphology and prey items in durophagous systems. To begin to investigate these interactions, we tested the force required by two tooth morphologies, one cupped and one pointed, to break model snail and mussel shells. We believed that the cupped tooth would best crush the snail shell, and the pointed tooth would best break the mussel shell. The pointed tooth was found to crush the snail shell at a lower force, while for the mussel shells there was no difference in crushing forces between tooth morphologies. Further study is needed to fully appreciate the interactions between tooth and prey morphologies, especially to be able to accurately predict an organisms\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 diet based on tooth shape.","3991":"The San Juan Islands of Washington State are a unique habitat for both humans and wildlife. Although they are in close proximity to the urban cities of Seattle and Tacoma, these islands remain relatively rural and have maintained close connections to wildlife. I will be working with Wolf Hollow Rehabilitation Center in Friday Harbor, WA on San Juan Island to evaluate human interactions and attitudes regarding wildlife. Within this study I will examine the major causes of injury and harm to wildlife as well as the differences of actions and attitudes towards terrestrial and marine wildlife. Based on these results, the educational tools employed by Wolf Hollow will be analyzed in order to see if they are effectively targeting certain gaps in human knowledge about wildlife.","3992":"The Friday Harbor Marina water quality project incorporates 5th grade educational outreach and the scientific testing of how anthropogenic development can increase concentrations of fecal pollution in the Friday Harbor Marina. Learning how outreach efforts are changing 5th graders\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 attitudes towards science may help revise future outreach projects. Additionally, understanding how development in Friday Harbor is influencing the health of the marina can target pollution management to highly-impacted areas. An attitudinal before and after survey was administered to test if students\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 scientific interests changed while testing six sites within the marina for fecal coliform contamination. Predictions concerning the increase in student attitudes were unfounded because before and after survey results were not statistically different. Fecal coliform levels were highest near sites of non-point and point source pollution, which corresponds with predictions about the degradation of water quality from development.","3993":"Climate change will alter life on Earth, but the specific impact on any given species is less certain. Most current forecasting models lump all members of a species under one climatic envelope, thus ignoring the possibility of local adaptation among isolated populations of a wide-ranging species to result in differing climatic needs for each population compared to the species as a whole. To provide experimental evidence of the importance of local adaptation, we test each life stage of seven populations of copepod Tigriopus californicus ranging fifteen degrees in latitude, expecting populations and possibly life stages to differ in thermal tolerance. Our results show populations living in cooler climates generally have a lower thermal tolerance, and also juveniles exhibit higher thermal tolerances than adults, which could affect how a population responds to changing conditions. Thus, it is important for models to consider the roles of adaptation and evolution in species survival.","3994":"As global biodiversity continues to decline greater attention is being paid on ways law can be a mechanism to advance conservator efforts. Currently, southern resident killer whales are listed as \u201a\u00c4\u00f2endangered\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 under the endangered species act. Comprising a population of 88 individuals it has been shown that disturbance by vessels may affect key behaviors and maskecholocation, which is critical for foraging and communication. Within the Puget Sound,Southern Residents are exposed routinely to commercial whale watching, and vessel interaction has been listed as a contributing factor to their endangered status. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration implemented federal vessel regulations in April 2011 with include a no parking in the path of whales\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 restriction and a 200-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eayard buffer between vessels and whales. Within May through September 2011 Soundwatch collected data pertaining to the number of vessels, the types of these vessels, and any observed incidents. What was found that on average 12 boats surround this population on a daily basis, with a maximum of 62 boats. These boats mostly comprise of commercial whale watching operations with 6 boats on average. Of the 2,500 incidents that were private boaters committed 58%, followed by the commercial industry with 21%. The top incidents that were committed were being within 200 yards and 100 yards of the whales, and being inshore of whales. As NOAA seeks to revise and enforce these federal regulations it is imperative to have accurate and consistent monitoring on the water.","3995":"Teeth are important in the breakdown and digestion of food. They are oftentimes a good indicator of an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fitness and survival. Though many have studied durophagous tooth morphologies and prey preference, no study has aimed to understand how crushing teeth work, and if there are prey-specific specializations. To understand tooth-prey interactions, we made two different aluminum tooth models: pointy and cup- shaped. Then, measured the force required by the teeth to initially break plaster snail and mussel shells produced by a 3-D printer. Assuming that the durophagous predator is able to consume its prey after an initial breakage, our results suggest that pointy teeth are more effective at crushing snail shells. However, neither tooth morphology is more effective in crushing mussel shells.","3996":"The San Juan Archipelago is ecologically important to numerous marine bird species. The Pelagic Ecosystem Function Apprenticeship has conducted Fall surveys in this area since 2006. This study took place in the San Juan Channel. It evaluates the abundance and community composition of marine bird populations in October and November of 2011. The most dominant families, Alcids and Gulls, were assessed. Species with the highest abundance were ranked over the last six years. Overall, the data does not display evidence of decline; stable abundance and community composition have been established. This is in opposition to other studies, which show general declines across marine bird populations over the last 40 years. However, long-term relationships have yet to be established in the San Juan Channel.","3997":"The San Juan Channel is a transitional area between marine and freshwater environments that influences the distribution, abundance and community composition of zooplankton. Zooplankton communities are highly variable seasonally and interannually due to the complexity of physical oceanography in the region. During the fall season in 2011, tidal regimes that characterize this estuarine environment appeared to spatially influence highly abundant Calanoid copepods and copepod nauplii. The results of this study suggest that tidal forcing exhibits a significant influence Calanoid copepods and copepod nauplii in the San Juan Channel, where spring flood tides influenced the Northern region and neap flood tides influenced the Southern region at depth. Spatial variation in the distribution of juvenile and adult copepods between these regions may be explained by behavioral patterns in copepod diapause, while depth variation in the Southern region may be driven by behavioral patterns in diel vertical migration. These investigations may begin to enhance our understanding of the relative life history stages of copepods as an influence on their distribution and abundance in the San Juan Channel.","3998":"The purpose of study was to investigate how physical and biological factors influence phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen spatially and temporally in San Juan Channel over fall and the annual cycle of 2011. Specific objectives were to 1) Spatially assess differences in the phytoplankton community by analyzing genera abundance over fall 2011 at North and South stations and compare spatial patterns with those found in chlorophyll, 2) temporally evaluate the correlation between chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen levels during fall 2011 at high resolution to infer whether phytoplankton, as indicated by chlorophyll, influences dissolved oxygen more than physical factors and 3) repeat the second analysis over the 2011 annual cycle. Phytoplankton genera in the San Juan Channel were consistently similar across stations and weekly cruises for fall 2011. Differences in phytoplankton genera were a result of single-species dominated periods. Phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll concentrations were found to decrease as the season progressed to winter, consistent with previous studies. Physical factors dominated the influence on dissolved oxygen both spatially, across North and South stations, and temporally throughout the year with the exception of July. In July, biological factors appeared to be equivalent to physical factors in influencing dissolved oxygen, as a result of high summer productivity.","3999":"The San Juan Channel is one passageway linking the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Thus, the physical oceanography of this region is complex and has both estuarine and oceanic influences. We sampled a 5-station transect along the San Juan Channel during fall 2011 as part of a multi-annual study started in 2004 and a monthly study started in early 2011. We deployed a CTD to gather information on temperature, salinity, and density structure in the water column. Temperature followed an annual cycle with cooling in the winter and warming in the summer, while haloclines were more tidally modulated. Short-term along-channel density structure was controlled by both tides and wind. Density stratification increased at the south end increased during flood tides, and at the north end and mid-channel during ebb tides. The depth and width of the pycnocline at the southern end of the channel were correlated to tidal height. These findings enhance our understanding of both short-term and long-term patterns in density gradients of the San Juan Channel pelagic environment.","4000":"Since 2005, one site has been studied in the San Juan Channel, located just off San Juan Island, Washington in the United States. This research has been done by the Pelagic Ecosystem Function Apprenticeship at the Friday Harbor Labs on San Juan Island. Continuing this research and focusing on mammals in the San Juan Channel, individual mammal species were counted in autumn 2011. 2011 abundances were calculated based on these counts, compared to abundances from 2007-2010, and looked at by date of sailing, zone in the study, and tidal phase present during each sailing in each zone. The zones were predetermined by the apprenticeship. Mammal individuals were counted using visual identification taken on day trips in October and November 2011. All mammal species seen across the study site, or transect , were counted during these sailings. The four mammals seen in the San Juan Channel in 2011 were Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina), Steller Sea Lions (Eumatopias jubatus), Harbor Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Poropoises (Phocoenoides dalli). Abundance for Harbor Seals was higher in 2010 and 2011 compared to years 2007-2009. Abundance for Harbor Porpoise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s in 2011 was significantly higher than years 2007 to 2010. Abundance for Steller Sea Lions and Dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Porpoise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s remained stable from 2007-2011. Harbor Seals were the most abundant mammal present in the study, and Dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Porpoise\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s were the least abundant. For the pinniped species, Harbor Seals and Steller Sea Lions showed no net change across season, but showed variation date to date. By zone, Harbor Seals showed some preference for Zone 3 in the study, and Steller Sea Lions showed high preference for Zone 5. By tidal phase, Harbor Seals and Steller Sea Lions both showed 3 preferences that differed in each zone. Abundance in relation to date, zone, and tidal phase for both species are likely effected by two factors; the location of haul out sites, as well as presence of prey.","4001":"Intertidal organisms have been investigated heavily in studies to understand how climate change may affect marine ecosystems, communities, and even individual species. Climate change may increase the environmental stresses of intertidal such as salinity fluctuation. The sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima is one of the abundant intertidal organisms along the west coast of North America. I examined whether A. elegantissima changes certain behaviors (contraction, expansion, and locomotion) under different salinity conditions. The results suggest that this sea anemone is better adapted to low salinity conditions than high salinities in response to disturbance. Individuals closed up faster in high salinity, and opened up slower in both low and high salinity conditions than in normal salinity. This species preferred to stay in low and high salinity conditions rather than being exposed to the air.","4002":"Although they are integral to many marine ecosystems, relatively little is known about euendolithic (shell-boring) organisms outside the tropics. Here, I present a short survey of euendoliths inhabiting a site on the Pacific coast of North America. Shells were collected from sites in the intertidal and subtidal zone off Point Caution, on San Juan Island, WA. Casts of boreholes were photographed with a scanning electron microscope, and their morphology and diameter was matched to previously isolated cultures. Several types of green algae, as well as cyanobacteria and fungi, were found in the intertidal shells. The 11 meter deep subtidal site was dominated by the green alga Ostreobium, and the 23 meter site by the cyanobacteria Leptolyngbya. Only heavily eroded tracings were found at the 30 meter deep site.","4003":"The intertidal limpet, Lottia scutum, is a key grazer keeping algal levels in check. Because limpets rely heavily on suction to prevent dislodgment during foraging, it is important to understand the tenacity of suction adhesion. Through use of a clamping measurement apparatus, underwater limpet tenacity was measured at various pulling speeds to quantify the speed and force required for limpet dislodgement. The purpose of this measurement was to determine the maximum tenacity that a limpet can achieve at varying pulling speeds. Instead of seeing one speed at which tenacity was maximized, I saw a trend of increasing tenacity over time. There was no effect of speed of separation on suction attachment. Stefan adhesion does not play a large, at least under my experimental conditions.","4004":"Adult distribution of intertidal bivalve communities is dependent on larval success and juvenile survival. Finding and predicting juvenile presence is crucial to understanding the mechanisms determining adult abundance. I sampled seven intertidal areas on San Juan Island, representing various wave exposures, sediment compositions, and beach slope to determine where juveniles are present and what factors might predict their presence. Juvenile clams were found at six of the seven sites sampled, in highest abundance at British Camp and Bell Point on the northeastern tip of the island, dominated by Nutricola spp. Juveniles of Mysella tumida, Saxidomus giganteus, Protothaca staminea, Macoma inquinata, and Macoma nasuta were also found. Clam assemblages seem to be site-specific, rather than being driven by tidal height or other individual environmental factors. Within sites, shell hash, mud and granules the best predictors of presence or absence of juveniles.","4005":"The Pacific sand lance, Ammodytes hexapterus, was tested for burrowing speed in a tank filled with sediment topped with seawater. Results show that in fine sand (0.520mm in diameter) young of the year sand lance burrow on average 0.03 seconds faster than do immature\/sub adults. These characteristics may be useful in predicting and identifying sand lance burrowing sites in the future, which is extremely important due to their ecological importance as prey species for many other marine species. This could be useful in identifying breeding sites for sand lances that can later be used as feeding grounds for marine species whose populations may be threatened.","4006":"Algae may be an answer to the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s future oil crisis but a lot of groundwork needs to be done before algae can provide enough oil to keep up with human consumption. Environmental stresses can cause diatoms to produce higher lipid contents and grow at different than normal rates. Three species of Pacific Northwest diatoms were observed in four different nutrient media, including two nutrient-reduced media, and in two different temperatures for highest growth rates. One species of Fragilaria sp. (strain # F084) showed little or no growth, while another species of Fragilaria sp. (strain # F074) grew best when all essential nutrients were present. Skeletonema sp. sp. (strain # F164) grew well in nutrient reduced media (F\/2+ 1\/2 NaNO3 and F\/2+ 1\/2 NaNO3) , as well as pink F\/2+, and another species of Fragilaria sp. (F074). grew best when all essential nutrients were present. This pilot study is the basis for future experiments into finding which Pacific Northwest diatom may be worthy of algal biofuel candidacy.","4007":"Environmental changes can affect the abundance and community structure of various intertidal organisms. Water flow rate is a determining factor in food abundance and settling rate of food particles. For this study, we used the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula, to study the effects of water flow on feeding rate. Many studies have been conducted involving beating rate, that is, how often barnacles extend their cirri. However little research has been done on how flow rates can affect the actual feeding rates of barnacles, meaning the rate at which they obtain food using their cirri. We predicted that in faster moving water barnacles would be able to obtain more food particles due to the flux of food around them. We also predicted that in slower moving water barnacles feeding rate would be lower because settling rate would be higher. These predictions led to the hypothesis that there must be an optimal flow rate at which feeding rate is highest. Our results showed that settling rates of food particles were highest in slower moving water, however, we were unable to obtain enough data about how feeding rates would vary with changing flow rates. In the future, more tests should be done using the improved methods we have developed in order to determine differences in barnacle feeding rates.","4008":"Calcium carbonate shells undergo dissolution in acidified conditions. As carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the ocean's pH is lowered. The limpet Lottia scutum is used in this experiment to demonstrate the affect of ocean acidification on calcium carbonate material, which many marine organisms possess. As a limpet's shell becomes brittle its life expectancy may become threatened by environmental conditions such as desiccation, sun and temperature exposure, as well as predation. Peak force from crushing limpet shells is used in this experiment to measure shell strength and show how strength is diminished in acidified water over time.","4009":"The discovery that fossil fuels are not a sustainable fuel source has led to a search for alternatives. Many marine biologists hypothesize that the answer may lie in algae, more specifically in microalgae. The purpose of this pilot study is to provide baseline data for future research for biofuel production. Using cultures exposed to different temperatures and media containing different levels of nutrients, I found that Asterionellopsis glacialis was the best candidate among the algae tested from the Pacific Northwest to pursue for potential biofuel production in warmer climates. This was based on its tolerance to different nutrient levels and temperatures.","4010":"Scallops are semi-mobile filter feeding bivalves; an important member of their ecosystems due to their ecological contributions and importance as bioindicators. Despite their importance, little is known about their diet and feeding habits. It is accepted that suspension feeding bivalves have the ability to select particles by size (Riisg\u221a\u2022rd 1988), and perhaps by chemical\/nutritional properties (Ward et al. 1998). In this study we aimed to answer the question as to whether scallop individuals, Chlamys rubida and Chlamys hastata, consumed different diets across depths and species, displayed through gut contents. This was done by capturing C. rubida and C. hastata individuals from two different depths and analyzing their diets via a random survey of the gut contents. An overall ANOSIM test of gut content assemblage showed no significant difference between species or depths (p-value= 0.35). This confirmed our null hypothesis that there would be no significant difference between diets of scallop individuals across species or depth. The same-diet phenomenon could be due to multiple reasons, including but not limited to the abundance of food at each depth or to the scallops\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 ability to select food.","4011":"Gut contents of two species of sea scallops, Chlamys rubida and C. hastata, were compared for individuals from the San Juan Channel collected in shallow (20m) and deep (~80m) habitats. Gut contents were preserved in paraformaldehyde and an Olympus microscope with 10x and 20x lenses was used to view phytoplankton. Food constituents of different categories were counted using an ocular micrometer transect. No noticeable trends regarding dietary constituents were seen across species or habitat which supports our null hypothesis. A count of identifiable diatoms showed that Thalassiosira and CF Melosira were the most abundant diatoms. In addition, CF Melosira was more abundant (~2x greater) in shallow animals from both species relative to deep animals. The results imply that both species of scallops are consuming similar organic and inorganic matter at different depths.","4012":"The proportion of live Crassostrea gigas infected with Polydorid spionid worms was surveyed at several locations around San Juan Island. Thirty infected C. gigas were collected from the Argyle Lagoon locations and worm galleries and holes on the inside and outside of shells were counted and assigned to a shell region. The proportion of borings that penetrate the inner layer of nacre was calculated. The area of each shell region was determined to find the density of worm populations and shells were cut to measure the thickness of different regions. Oyster populations with the highest proportion of infected individuals also had higher per--\u201a\u00c4\u00ea shell population densities. The proportion of nacre invasions remained constant as the population density of worms varied. Although the average thickness of the whole shell did not affect the proportion of inner nacre borings, the adductor scar and hinge regions showed a negative correlation between nacre bore holes and thickness.","4013":"The barnacle, Balanus glandula, is a good experimental organism for studying the impacts of both temperature and flow rate on filter feeding efficiency. Such knowledge has important implications for understanding the physiological constraints under which organisms operate, information necessary for predicting species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 responses to environmental changes. As a first step toward this larger goal, I tested the feasibility of using brine shrimp cysts as prey organisms for B. glandula feeding studies. Specifically, the experiment examined the ability of B. glandula to ingest brine shrimp cysts and pass them through its digestive tract. This experiment demonstrated that B. glandula do ingest cysts, but the number of cysts ingested per individual is highly variable. Approximately half of the individuals tested did not consume any cysts within the 24hr feeding period. Of the ones who did, the number of ingested cysts ranged from 2 to 207. With one exception, all cysts had passed through the guts of the animals within 24hr. These results suggest a reasonable strategy for analyzing feeding efficiency would be to examine the number of brine shrimp cysts in the feces of individual animals following feeding periods at different water flow rates and temperatures.","4014":"Two different experimental systems were used to evaluate sources of error in carbonate chemistry measurements at Friday Harbor Labs, WA. One system, set up in Laboratory 6, examined the effects of different filters and a UV sterilizer. The second system explored the carbon input from feeding live versus dead algae in the presence of mussels, Mytilus trossulus. The use of an activated charcoal filter and UV sterilizer increased the pH of incoming seawater more than that of a pleated sediment filter and UV sterilizer. There were no discernable changes in the Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), and no trends could be seen in Total Alkalinity. Feeding live or dead algae produced similar results over most carbonate measurements. All treatments decreased treatment tank pH, increased tank pCO2, and increased tank DIC. However, feeding dead algae notably decreased treatment tank Total Alkalinity, while mussels that were fed live food did not show a difference in this parameter when compared to non-treated water.","4015":"\u00d4\u00aa\u00f8\u00d4\u00aa\u00f8Open ocean observations have shown that increasing levels of anthropogenically-derived atmospheric CO2 are causing acidification of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s oceans. Yet little is known about coastal acidification and very few studies have characterized the carbonate chemistry of coastal zones or intertidal rock pools where many calcifying organisms exist. In addition to various physical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (D.O.), and salinity), we characterized the carbonate chemistry by taking measurements of pH, total alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of two tide pools (0.41 m3 and 0.10 m3) located at Dead Man\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Cove on San Juan Island, Washington, to determine the extent of variation over the course of one tidal cycle and compared those results to local water samples taken from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Both tidal pools exhibited extreme values in carbonate chemistry over the course of the day (for the 0.41 m3 tide pool: 7.36 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 8.60 pH, 2116.53 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 1669.86 \u0152\u00bamol kg-1 total alkalinity, 2171.5 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 1216.1 \u0152\u00bamol kg-1 DIC, and 2088.494 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 57.448 \u0152\u00baatm pCO2) and calcite and aragonite saturation states (0.623-6.84 \u0152\u00a9 Ca, 0.392-4.388 \u0152\u00a9 Ar). On separate, consecutive days, the alga Ulva sp. and the mussle Mytilus trossulus were added to the smaller of the tide pools to observe the potential impact of photosynthetic versus respiring biomass on the carbonate chemistry. Adding algae resulted in an expected increase in pH, a decrease in DIC, and an increase in \u0152\u00a9 Ca and \u0152\u00a9 Ar. Total alkalinity decreased less than expected; perhaps due to the shading of coralline algae by Ulva which may have prevented coralline calcification. pCO2 decreased less than expected on day 2 relative to day 1 in the treatment pool and may have been due to changes in weather relative to the first day. Addition of mussels resulted in an expected increase in DIC, an increase in pCO2 and reductions in \u0152\u00a9 Ca and \u0152\u00a9 Ar. D.O. did not increase and pH did not decrease as much as expected on day 3 in the treatment pool and these unexpected findings may be due to the fact that mussels were not allowed to acclimate. Excretion of ammonium or addition of organic acids from added mussels may have offset a reduction in total alkalinity. This study demonstrates that many intertidal species are experiencing far greater fluctuations in carbonate chemistry than expected and has significant implications for ocean acidification experiments where intertidal species are used.","4016":"Tide pools are known to have extreme variations in both their temperature and carbonate chemistry while they are isolated from the surrounding waters. These extreme environments provide an interesting view into how organisms are able to cope with large variations in temperature, pH and total carbon. The knowledge of how organisms cope with high temperature and low pH conditions will be beneficial when contemplating how organisms will deal with the conditions that are expected to come from global warming and ocean acidification in the not-too-distant future. In this study we observe several physical and chemical characteristics of two tide pools, comparing them to each other as well as to the waters surrounding them. We then manipulate one of the tide pools (by adding photosynthesizing organisms on one day and respiring organisms on the next day) in order to observe the biological impact on the carbon chemistry of a tide pool.","4017":"Tidepools are a prominent feature of the intertidal zone, housing a great diversity of both macroalgae and mobile animal components. Tidepool organisms are exposed to wide variations in temperature, salinity, and pH over the course of the low tide. As of yet, very few studies have quantified the changes in carbonate chemistry in tidepools. The objective of this study was to quantify the changes in carbonate chemistry in tidepools over the course of three consecutive low tides and to determine if biological additions would alter the degree of change in carbonate parameters occurring over the course of the low tide. The carbonate chemistry in the tidepools we surveyed underwent drastic changes over the course of the low tide. With increasing isolation time, the total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon decreased, and the pH increased. However, no signal from the addition of Ulva sp. or Mytilus trossulus was detected in this study.","4018":"Characterization of physical conditions in tide pools is quite common in the scientific literature, but there is a marked paucity of information regarding the carbonate chemistry of these ecosystems; the majority of studies focus on temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen measurements. This lack of information is especially worrisome in light of the predicted changes in carbonate chemistry (Ocean Acidification) likely to result from an increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In order to establish a baseline of comparison, we analyzed the carbonate chemistry of two tide pools at Dead Man\u201a\u00c4\u00f2s Cove on San Juan Island, WA. We found marked deviation in carbonate chemistry parameters in the tide pools from the nearby water of Haro Strait. We also attempted to elucidate the underlying causal factors of this deviation by adding biota to the tide pools, yet our results were inconclusive. We conclude that future work should focus on more extensive characterization of natural coastal and intertidal variation in carbonate chemistry parameters, as well as experimental design targeted at determining underlying causal factors of said variation in nature.","4019":"During the low tide, tidepools are under different physio-chemical conditions than the coastal waters. This includes the carbonate chemistry, which is especially pertinent to study due to the threat of ocean acidification on carbonate chemistry. We examined the fluctuation in DIC, total alkalinity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity in two tide pools in Dead Man\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Cove, San Juan Island, WA over the course of the low tide. To better understand the relative contributions of photosynthesizers and respirers to changes in carbonate chemistry, we added Ulva to one pool on the second day, and Mytilus trossulus on the third day. During the low tide, tidepools saw a decrease in DIC and alkalinity, and an increase in pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. There is evidence of a small signal of decrease in DIC due to Ulva addition and increased DIC due to Mytilus addition. Tidepools experience huge swings in carbonate chemistry that suggests an ability of the organisms that inhabit the pools to cope with large changes in pH over the course of the day.","4020":"Knowledge of harbor seal distribution, abundance, and site fidelity is essential for conservation, as is knowledge of female-pup behavior. I focused on these elements in this study by assessing haul-out tendencies of a local population of harbor seals on Yellow Island, Washington, and contrasting these characteristics between female-pup pairs and solitary seals. I found that seal abundance varied with temperature, tidal height, and time of day, although these factors were not independent and worked simultaneously to determine haul-out abundance. Female-pup pairs hauled out in proportion to the number of female-pup pairs at the study site, suggesting these pairs were not more likely to haul-out than solitary seals under any conditions. It is possible that due to the unique adaptations of harbor seals during the pupping season, including a maternal foraging cycle and comparatively precocial pups, females and their young did not have different haul-out needs than other seals. However, females with young remained in the study site for a longer period of time, even as haul-out sites decreased. This finding was consistent with other studies demonstrating the increased site fidelity and decreased length of foraging trips of females with pups during the pupping season. Aggregating in haul-out areas may also be a predator avoidance mechanism.","4021":"Surveying the habitat, interactions between harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and the habitat and also their behavior is important to better understanding these seals. The number of seals hauled out on each site was compared to tide height and the number of seals in the water was compared between those in the fast current and those in the slow current. Distance was also measured from the lookout point to each site and compared to the number of seals on each haul out site. As the tide height increased, the number of seals hauled out on sites A and F decreased dramatically, while those on B, D and E remained the relatively the same, which shows that those from A and F did not move to the closer haul out sites. The tide height and what time of day seemed to have an effect on the number of seals in the water and the proportion of how many were in the fast current compared to those in the slow current. Also, distance may be an important factor because more seals were hauled out on A and F, which are much further away from observers on land than other sites. The closer sites were used mainly by nursing mom\u201a\u00c4\u00eapup pairs.","4022":"Changes in tidal patterns affect the prey composition of the two most common pinnipeds in the San Juan Channel, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and Steller sea lion (Eumatopias jubatus).Tidal influences are therefore likely to affect the distribution, abundance and behavior of these pinnipeds. This study sought to determine the relationship between the frequency, distribution and behavior of harbor seals and sea lions with tidal phase and discuss the differences between the two species. While harbor seals showed greater variations in all three categories and distribution trends in sea lions were harder to distinguish, results support the idea that both species are affected by changes in tidal currents.","4023":"After considerable increase in numbers over the past decades, Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) may have reached carrying capacity in western parts of Washington. I studied the behavior of a Bald Eagle pair at Avenue Point, San Juan Island, Washington from 8-20 August 2011. Specifically, I recorded four behavior types (sitting, scanning, preening, and moving) at four-minute intervals during an observation period. I also noted eagle vocalizations and the relative distance between pair members along the shoreline. Behaviorally, eagles spent the majority of their time sitting (46%), followed by scanning (26%), preening (20%), and moving (7%). This might be justified energetically, due to the necessity during the post-breeding season of conserving energy for migration to wintering grounds. I saw only two predation attempts, both entailing fish prey and both unsuccessful, though other observers reported successful fish and gull predations during my study period. Vocalizations were separated into \u201a\u00c4\u00fachatters\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 and \u201a\u00c4\u00fapeals\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. Chatters were 8 times more likely to be used when two or more eagles were present, whereas \u201a\u00c4\u00fapeals\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 were 5 times more likely to occur when either one or &gt; two eagles were present. This result suggests that chatter calls are used for communicating within a pair, while peals are used for territorial purposes. The pair of eagles I studied spent &gt;70% of their time between 5 m and 300 m apart from one other. This suggests that during the post-breeding stage they prefer to separate themselves spatially along their territory\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shoreline, as opposed to perching close together. However, evidence of the pair\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bond was still seen during this period, and I would occasionally see playful nipping of each other\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s bills and mutual greetings.","4024":"Southern Resident Killer Whales have been studied since their population was harmed by live captures for aquariums and has not recovered since that time. Further understanding of their behavior could assist conservation efforts. Killer whales spend the majority of their time underwater, so surface behaviors are one of the few accessible forms of study. Observations were made from the West Side Scenic Preserve to assess the frequency of surface behaviors between periods when the whales were milling versus traveling. Surface behaviors occurred more frequency during milling, especially pectoral slaps. Only breaching behavior occurred equally while milling and traveling. An opportunistic observation allowed me to assess changes in the frequency of SRKW surface behaviors when they were in the vicinity of transient killer whales. Surface behavior activity increased substantially in the presence of transient killer whales; especially tail slaps and other percussive behaviors. Further study needs to be done to investigate the frequency of surface behaviors for better insight of the SRKW population.","4025":"Southern resident killer whales seasonally inhabit the Salish Sea waters of British Columbia and Washington and are unique in their feeding behavior. This endangered subpopulation is also a valued resource that has led to a large whale watch industry. Whale watch boats are potentially a threat to the orcas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 well being. As a means of assessing alternative ways to view whales, I observed orcas from land, on the west side of San Juan Island, and from three vessels. Results showed no remarkable difference between platforms in ability to detect whales and behaviors, suggesting that whale watch boats are not the only way to see whales during summer. I also observed patterns in my data, correlating the whales\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 movement with tides and currents.","4026":"I present data taken during observations of harbor seal haul-outs and evaluate what effect temperature has on the number of seals hauled out on rocks. I propose some possibilities as to what might be influencing harbor seal behavior and haul-out preferences. Data is presented to lend evidence to the hypothesis that temperature is negatively correlated to seal numbers. Difficulty in separating temperature from other key variables, such as time of day, is addressed. Other studies are reviewed to examine congruity or lack thereof in findings and interpretations of harbor-seal haul-out patterns.","4027":"This study, conducted on San Juan Island, Washington during late summer, assessed variation in diving behavior of pelagic cormorants relative to time of day and tidal currents. Mean dive lengths did not differ significantly between morning and afternoon periods. However, dive lengths were longer during ebb versus flood tides and dive lengths also increased with the speed of water currents where diving occurred. To explore the possibility of physiological adaptations to low oxygen availability, the length of rest periods following dives was measured to see if pelagic cormorants displayed dive time to rest time rations that deviated from the a 1:1 ratio typical of aerobic diving. Because they do not strictly adhere to the predicted 1:1 ratio of aerobic dive time to rest time, pelagic cormorants likely have additional adaptations that allow them to cope with reduced access to oxygen.","4028":"Rhinoceros Auklets and gulls use the San Juan Channel as foraging grounds. They have shown complementary roles in feeding activity; a kleptoparasitism interaction. Few studies have characterized the Rhinoceros Auklets and gulls community distribution over the summer. Therefore, investigating the short-term variation in gulls and Rhinoceros Auklets abundance during the summer is important because it can help us understand the complete and present ecology. To determine the distribution of abundance of these seabirds, I performed standard strip-transect methods and analyzed tidal direction. In addition, we used past season data to determine a definitive pattern in abundance. The R2 value provided by the line of regression was used to determine the anklets-gull relationship. Here we report and discuss the patterns in distribution and abundance across the San Juan Channel. A definite pattern for Anklets-gull relationship was not attained due to the low abundance of gulls throughout the channel.","4029":"Harlequin Ducks molt and winter in the San Juan Islands of Washington state. This study investigated habitat choice and feeding behavior of Harlequin Ducks around Cattle Point on San Juan Island by comparing time foraging versus resting in different habitats. In the water, ducks performed three behaviors while foraging: surface feeding, diving, or dabbling. Across observation periods, Harlequin Ducks spent on average 80% of the time foraging, and only 20% of the time hauled-out and resting. The ducks spent the more time foraging in areas of low current and high vegetation and the least time at areas high current and low vegetation. The mild climate in the San Juan Archipelago could allow the ducks to spend more time foraging to meet their in-molt energetic needs by reducing the need to thermoregulate.","4030":"The distribution and abundance of Rhinoceros Auklets is related to the tide cycle. I examined the effects of tidal currents phase on the distribution and abundance of the Rhinoceros Auklets though land-based surveys of the waters within Cattle Pass, Washington. Auklets aggregated in large groups inside Cattle Pass during flooding tides. During the slack high tide numbers dropped to intermediate levels, and then declined during ebbing tides and remained very low until the next flooding tide. During flooding tides the birds aggregated in the north end of the pass where prey availability was highest. Low abundance during the ebbing tide was attributed to high prey concentrations in the south end of the pass outside of the survey area. Auklets strongly preferred the center of the pass, where the main current flowed, over the calmer water closer to shore. This study shows the importance of the tide cycle in influencing the daily movements of Rhinoceros Auklets.","4031":"Southern resident killer whales seasonally inhabit the Salish Sea waters of British Columbia and Washington and are unique in their feeding behavior. This endangered subpopulation is also a valued resource that has led to a large whale watch industry. Whale watch boats are potentially a threat to the orcas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 well being. As a means of assessing alternative ways to view whales, I observed orcas from land, on the west side of San Juan Island, and from three vessels. Results showed no remarkable difference between platforms in ability to detect whales and behaviors, suggesting that whale watch boats are not the only way to see whales during summer. I also observed patterns in my data, correlating the whales\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 movement with tides and currents.","4032":"Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are fish predators that are commonly found in coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest. They are frequently seen swimming or hauled out during lower tides on rocks in the San Juan Islands during the summer months. I studied associations of swimming seals with tidal currents of different speeds. To do this, I observed a group of seals off the west coast of Yellow Island in the northern San Juan Channel at various intervals during a two-week period in August 2011. Near one particular haul out site, seals appeared to prefer slower currents during low tide when differences in adjacent current speeds were greater than during higher tides. Seals swam near this site more than near any other overall. Seals swam more during late afternoon hours, and mother seals and their pups were associated mainly with slower currents near shoreline.","4033":"Odontocetes rely on echolocation clicks to navigate, forage and communicate. As such, understanding the characters of click shall help understanding whale communication. Southern resident killer whales of the North Pacific Ocean are recorded echolocating at Lime Kiln State Park and characteristics of the echolocation clicks are explored. This study aims to describe the nature of killer whale vocalization by analyzing their calls and echolocation characteristics. Click train duration, number of clicks and duration of individual clicks are measured and tested against the hypothesis that they should follow a normal curve. Results mostly confirmed previous studies of the echolocation click\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s predominant characteristics in terms of click train duration of ( &lt;10 seconds), number of clicks in a click train ( 0-50 clicks) and individual click duration (&lt;2ms). However, results failed to accept the hypothesis that the characteristics should follow a normal distribution. Suspected reason for such result lies in limitations of the acoustic data\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s collection methods, such as immobility of the hydrophones and unknown location of the killer whales respect to hydrophones. In addition, factors of conducting a short-term bioacoustic study are discussed.","4034":"The rocky intertidal zone is a stressful environment inhabited by many organisms with specialized adaptations. One adaptation seen in several families of fish is to use a pelvic suctorial organ to attach to the substrate. This suction mechanism has been detailed in numerous fishes, but there is yet work to be done with how these structures are organized internally. My goal was to produce a three-dimensional model that could readily interact current knowledge of sucker disk morphology, development, and function. I used the software Amira to generate a 3-D model of the elements comprising the suctorial region of Eumicrotremus orbis. This model is easily manipulated and can be reproduced and studied to determine the function of each element. Comparisons with models of different stages of this species as well as models of other species will help us begin answering the question of how such an adaptation originated.","4035":"Teeth are important in the breakdown and digestion of food. They are oftentimes a good indicator of an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fitness and survival. Though many have studied durophagous tooth morphologies and prey preference, no study has aimed to understand how crushing teeth work, and if there are prey-specific specializations. To understand tooth-prey interactions, we made two different aluminum tooth models: pointy and cup- shaped. Then, measured the force required by the teeth to initially break plaster snail and mussel shells produced by a 3-D printer. Assuming that the durophagous predator is able to consume its prey after an initial breakage, our results suggest that pointy teeth are more effective at crushing snail shells. However, neither tooth morphology is more effective in crushing mussel shells.","4036":"There are many things to consider when setting up experimental laboratories, especially in the context of ocean acidification. We studied the impact of biomass load and flow-through rate on the carbonate chemistry of aquaria at two different levels of pH. We found that all of these factors play a large role in how consistent you can expect to maintain the chemistry of your system. In the flow-through system we observed decreased levels of pH relative to the control tanks for all levels of biomass. Our static experimental system experienced very large fluctuations in chemistry over short time periods. Our results indicate that it is necessary for pilot studies of this nature to be performed before ocean acidification laboratory studies are undertaken. Factors like biological load and flow-through rate are likely to influence the chemistry of any experiment.","4037":"This is the first study that characterizes the carbonate parameters in the Salish Sea surrounding the San Juan Archipelago. Water samples were collected from 9 sites on multiple days and analyzed for total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon. Results show high spatial and temporal variability in carbonated parameters. Levels of pCO2 roughly fluctuated between 400 and 950 \u0152\u00baatm. The sites are likely highly influenced by freshwater pulses and tidal exchanges. Stark differences between areas of hypothesized high and low water retention were not observed within this sampling scheme.","4038":"Due to the dynamic nature of the water masses in the San Juan archipelago, the carbonate chemistry has not yet been well defined in space and time. For this short-term study during a neap to spring tidal cycle in mid July 2011, we analyzed water samples as far west as Kellett Bluff and as far east as East Sound for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), temperature, and salinity at depths of 10 meters. As expected, we found variability across space and time that may be in part explained by a freshwater signal from the Fraser River, differences in flow and flushing rates, the physical geography and the resultant estuarine and ocean circulation. With continued and more expansive sampling, this data will have pertinence for the larger and future dialogue about ocean acidification in coastal environments.","4039":"The carbonate chemistry of the San Juan Archipelago is extremely varied between regions of low to high tidal flushing. Salinity seems to be a driving parameter of the carbonate system through its effects on alkalinity. Freshwater from the Fraser River may control the environmental characteristics of water moving through the archipelago. In areas of low flushing, biological effects may strongly influence the carbonate chemistry. The effects of upwelling, especially on the west side are understudied. Overall, the water of the different sounds, channels, and straits of the islands are exchanged and equilibrated by mixing during strong spring tides. It is important to understand the interplay between environmental and biological controllers of carbonate chemistry to interpret changes that may be observed with the advent of ocean acidification.","4040":"Natural variability in the carbonate system is difficult to control in the lab. Furthermore, environmental carbonate chemistry data over small spatial scales is lacking. We measured discrete water samples across various flushing regimes in the San Juan Archipelago every other day during low slack tide over one neap to spring tidal transition. After analyzing these samples for temperature, salinity, total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon, we plotted these variables across space and time. Our data suggest that although carbonate chemistry varies through space and time, biological processes and tidal cycles may have a significant influence on the local marine chemistry. Our study aims to inform those interested in ocean acidification research about the natural variation of various carbonate system parameters in the San Juan Archipelago.","4041":"The absorption of carbon dioxide into the ocean acidifies the waters and has the potential to drastically alter the chemistry upon which organisms and ecosystems depend. This effect, however, is expected to vary between water masses that already differ in terms of their existing carbonate chemistry. The San Juan Archipelago is an ever-changing, complex estuarine ecosystem with little published literature regarding spatial and temporal variation in its carbonate chemistry. After measuring DIC and TA between the neap and spring tide at nine locations throughout the archipelago, we found that the water differs through space and time \u201a\u00c4\u00ec both throughout the monthly tidal cycle as well as the daily tidal cycle. Measurements for six parameters \u201a\u00c4\u00ec salinity, temperature, DIC, TA, pCO2 and pH \u201a\u00c4\u00ec were analyzed to further understand how areas that experience low, medium and high amounts of flushing over the tidal cycle may differ in their water chemistry. Due to few replicates and insufficient sampling days, we were only able to conclude that the Fraser River, tides and likely biology all impact the carbonate chemistry of the region. We hope that further studies will be conducted in the region to better quantify how well it will withstand increasing ocean acidification.","4042":"Within the bilateria, in the group Lophotrochozoa, there are at least two phyla that have evolved coloniality: Bryozoa and Entoprocta. Most of the phyla are solitary, and reproduce only sexually (Davidson et al. 2004). However, several other phyla, such as annelids and flatworms, have the ability to reproduce asexually (Yoshida et al. 2010) (Kobayashi et al. 2009). Phylogenetic analysis of Phoronida and Brachiopoda showed it to form a monophyletic clade (Cohen et al. 1998), but some species of phoronids such as Phoronis vancouverensis form a clump. People have long questioned if this clump is colonial, yet I have been unable to find scientific reports that indicate how individuals of P. vancouverensis are related to one another within a clump. There are three possibilities, or combinations thereof, for the relationship among the clump of P. vancouverensis. The first possibility is that individuals of P. vancouverensis within a clump are solitary and reproduce only sexually. The second possibility is that P. vancouverensis has the ability to produce asexually by budding or fission, but individuals do not maintain connections in a clump. The third possibility is that P. vancouverensis is truly colonial, thus physically connected to one another and exhibits asexual reproduction in addition to sexual reproduction.","4043":"Gene flow is important in maintaining genetic variation and replenishing locally disrupted populations. Because of the importance of gene flow, predicting dispersal patterns and connectivity in marine ecosystems is essential for effective conservation and management (Gray 1997, Lipcius et al. 2008). Most benthic marine invertebrates disperse only during a pelagic larval period, which varies in length between and among species (Krug 2009). Since an organism with a relatively long Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD) can potentially travel farther than an organism that settles sooner, PLD was initially used as an indicator of connectivity (Shanks et al. 2003). However, results from studies on a variety of invertebrates show that PLD is not a consistent predictor of connectivity (Lester and Ruttenberg 2005, Shanks 2009). These results suggest that chemical and environmental signals may induce larval settlement and metamorphosis sooner than expected (Strathmann et al. 2002, Weersing and Toonen 2009, Kelly and Palumbi 2010).","4044":"The axonal guidance molecules slit and robo are known to interact producing a repulsive signal to the growing processes of nerve cells during development. These signals contribute to the proper \u201a\u00c4\u00f2wiring\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 of nervous systems. Ascidians possess comparatively simple nervous systems, yet still require mechanisms to establish proper synaptic connectivity. In this paper I attempted to identify and clone slit and robo from two ascidians, Boltenia villosa and Molgula oculata. I was unable clone slit or robo sequences from either of these organisms, but was wable to analyze the sequences from the Molgula transcriptome sequences. I constructed gene trees for both genes with available Genbank sequences. These trees grouped vertebrates together, but in both cases the high sequence divergence in the invertebrates resulted in a weak phylogenetic signal leading to a polytomy among the invertebrates.","4045":"In the molgulid clade of ascidians several species have individually evolved tail loss during their larval stage of development. The notochord, one of the key features of chordates, is found in the center of the tail in most ascidian larvae. In almost all solitary ascidians, including M. oculata, 40 notochord cells have been found extended in the tail. However, in a closely related species, M. occulta (tailless), only 20 notochord cells were found, and these express brachyury. These two species are only 10% divergent at a transcriptomic level and are able to cross hybridize. Some of the hybrid also have 20 notochord cells, however the notochord cells extend and converge in a shortened version of M. oculata tail. Through the use of high throughput sequencing technologies and experimental techniques, we are able to investigate the express of genes associated with notochord development in the parent species and in the hybrid. Several genes\u201a\u00c4\u00eeFGF9\/16\/20, prickle (pk), noto6, leprecan, merlin, and noto17\u201a\u00c4\u00eewere analyzed for presence, temporal and spatial expression. FGF9\/16\/20, pk, noto6, leprecan, merlin, and noto1 were found to be present in both species. Pk expression pattern was found to be similar to Ci-pk2.","4046":"We know there are some genes responsible for the body segmentation through research done with Drosophila melanogaster. Some examples of these genes are engrailed and wingless, that belong to the segment-polarity genes class, and even-skipped, hairy and fushi-tarazu belonging to pair-rule gene class (Davis, G. k. and Patel, N. H., 1999). Engrailed is conserved among arthropods and has been shown to function like a segment formation gene in annelids. The expression of segment-polarity genes has been characterized in few annelid species and the expression patterns vary among the species characterized (Seaver, E. C. and Kaneshige, L. M., 2006). I intended to compare the development of segment formation among three annelid species, Boccardia proboscidea, Notomastus sp. (Capitellidae family) and Spirorbid sp. Beyond the comparison of segment development, I intended to see if they have similar expression patterns, or vary among the species.","4047":"Ascidians are highly studied in evolution and development because they have a tiny chordate tadpole larva. As a sister clade to vertebrates, ascidian research has lead to greater understanding of the molecular roles of developmental genes in vertebrates. However, recent research on a Phlebobranchia ascidian Ciona intestinalis indicates that the developmental gene hedgehog (hh) may have undergone a duplication independent to the hh duplications in vertebrates (Hudson, et al. 2011). To investigate this hypothesis, more research is needed on the other ascidian clade, Stolibranchia. In this study we strived to use maximum-likelihood analysis to compare the evolution of hh in Stolidobranchia and Phleobranchia ascidians. Future research will investigate the different developmental roles of hh in Stolidobranchia and Phlebobranchia ascidians.","4048":"The evolution of the chordate body plan is still unresolved. Notochord evolution can be studied with two tunicates\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe tailed M. oculata and the tailless M. occulta. The tailed M. oculata has 40 notochord cells that are converged and extended. The tailless M. occulta does not form a tail in their larval stage as it only has 20 notochord cells that have not converged or extended. A hypothesis for the loss of notochord cells in M. occulta is that the notochord cells are being destroyed by apoptosis (programmed cell death). In this study, preparations for studying programmed cell death (PCD) using two genes Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) and Programmed cell death interacting protein 6 (PCDIP6) were made for in situ hybridizations. A cell death assay and in situ hybridizations will be done in the future on a variety of developmental stages of both the tailed and tailless species to assess differential regulation of the PCD genes. These studies elucidate if differential regulation of PCD is potentially the cellular mechanism for the loss of a tail in M. occulta.","4049":"Lateralization of cognitive functions seems to be exceptionally widespread in nature and have been demonstrated to occur in multiple taxa. Previous studies using fish as models have suggested that social behaviours such as schooling may covary with behavioural lateralization at the population-level. Here, we assess the strength, degree and repeatability of behavioural lateralization in schooling fish. Two of the species studied (Aulorhynchus flavidus and Gasterosteus aculeatus) were found to express population-level symmetry in the direction of lateralization whereas one species (Ammodytes hexapterus) showed no indication of population-level lateralization. We also provide evidence that behavioral lateralization is repeatable over time. From our cross-species comparisons we conclude that population-level lateralization is not necessarily related to a gregarious life-style. Further studies should test repeatability over longer periods of time and the role of lateralization in schooling behavior.","4050":"Swimming represents the primary means through which fishes interact with their environment, and factors influencing swimming performance can profoundly affect their distribution and survivorship. Traditional measures of swimming performance are estimated under laboratory conditions using steady water flow. However, these experiments potentially underestimate the actual cost of swimming under unsteady water flows that characterize natural systems. Using a swimming respirometer and video recordings, we swam Cymatogaster aggregata using a standard Ucrit swimming trial under one of three flow conditions with the same mean water velocity at each speed increment: steady flow (control), low amplitude water velocity fluctuations ( A=0.5BLs-1) and high amplitude water velocity fluctuations (A=1BLs-1). We found that unsteady flows increase the metabolic cost of swimming, but only when high flows push a swimming fish beyond the threshold for exclusively aerobic metabolism (beyond Uburst). Furthermore, unsteady flows at the highest amplitude treatment decreased the maximum mean velocity (Ucrit) and mean gait transition velocity (Upc) achieved by individuals compared to the control and low amplitude unsteady flows. However, lower costs of swimming than predicted in low amplitude flows below Uburst suggest that fish are able to take advantage of the cyclical wave patterns and economize energy expenditure. Mean pectoral fin beat frequency did not differ significantly among treatments. This is the first study exploring the costs of swimming under unsteady flow in a marine labriform swimmer.","4051":"While the use of accelerometers in the aquatic environment becomes an increasingly used tool in remotely observing animals; however, the data obtained from deploying accelerometers still needs better understanding. Observations gathered by studies using accelerometers are largely limited to the identification of simple behaviours such as resting and swimming, yet fine-scale movements such as feeding and escape responses are mostly undetected. In this experiment, we aim to establish a link between acceleration traces and fast-start movements in the Great Sculpin (M. polyacanthocephalus) by the analysis of acceleration data from accelerometers and a high-speed video camera. Feeding events, escape events and spontaneous movements were triggered and observed using a 100Hz recording accelerometer (Little Leonardo Ltd, Japan) and a high-speed video camera for n = 7 great sculpin. Kinematic comparison between acceleration obtained from accelerometers and high-speed video camera were performed using vector transformation, yet prove to be difficult due to differences in reference frames and different sources of error. To establish a link between behaviour and acceleration, statistical analysis shows that the signature of spontaneous events can be described by the variation of the magnitude of acceleration which is significantly lower in spontaneous events compared to fast-start movements. Most of this information is lost (50%) if the accelerometer sampling rate is lower than 30Hz. Furthermore, two parameters (the value of Amax the variation of acceleration in lateral and forward direction) allow us to differentiate between escape events and feeding events. These results are a valuable contribution to understanding acceleration data in the field and the issues associated with low sampling rates.","4052":"Intraspecific variation in swimming performance, morphology and escape responses was assessed in the labriform shiner perch, Cymatogaster aggregata. Shiner perch were videotaped while swimming in a respirometer during a critical swimming speed (Ucrit) protocol. The degree of individual variation in both oxygen consumption rate (\u00b7\u03c0\u00c4O2) and kinematic performance was evaluated from this Ucrit challenge. Fast escape performance was also evaluated in the same group of fish. There was an approximately two-fold variation in metabolic rate of fish swimming at 0.5 body lengths per second (MR@0.5 bl s-1) and active metabolic rate, aerobic scope for swimming and critical swimming speed. A significant correlation was found between active metabolic rate and aerobic scope and between MR@0.5 bl s-1 and aerobic scope. Similarly there was a significant relationship between active metabolic rate and Ucrit. Individual variation in swimming performance could not be explained by differences in morphology of the caudal or pectoral fins or variation in body shape or size. There were no significant relationships between stage of escape response completed and any metabolic variables indicating that anaerobic escape responses are independent of aerobic capacity of the fish.","4053":"Due to the generalist nature of its diet, the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) has been thought to be an indicator of change in ecosystems. By utilizing expected patterns in salmon presence, this study sought to assess the capacity of harbor seal foraging to act as an accurate proxy for salmon presence and activity in Cattle Pass, Washington. Salmon were expected to be present in the channel beginning mid-summer, at which point it should be easier for individual fish to migrate northward through Cattle Pass during northward-flowing flooding tides. During the summers of 2010 and 2011, harbor seal presence and foraging was observed with respect to tidal phase and current velocity. Of all salmon captures observed during 2010, 79.2% occurred during flooding tides and 65.81% occurred during the month of August. During 2010, harbor seal foraging reflected expected seasonal and tidal patterns of salmon presence in the pass. Results support the proposal that with additional data collection, harbor seal foraging has the potential to act as successful indicators of salmon presence and activity in Cattle Pass.","4054":"Ascidian tsessile hermaphroditic filter-feeders found in marine environments (Huber et al ., 2000). Tunicates are urochordates (i.e.) because they possess the defining chordate structure, the notochord, in a larval tail that is reabsorbed upon metamorphosis. This tail is believed to benefit progeny by facilitating motility, which in turn permits a wider variety of anchoring environments and a higher probability of finding favorable settling conditions (Huber et al ., 2000). Despite the utility of this adaptation the larval notochord has been independently lost several times among the ascidians (Huber et al ., 2000). These anural, or tailless, tunicates occur with the highest frequency in the Molgulidae family (Huber et al ., 2000).","4055":"Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) can provide vital nutrients to coastal systems. Conversely, it can also lead to eutrophication of coastal waters, especially if the groundwater contains anthropogenic pollutants. This paper presents two studies encompassing this topic: a field study quantifying SGD at four sites in the San Juan Archipelago in the Northeast Pacific and a mesocosm experiment examining the effects of nitrate enrichment (30\u0152\u00baM and 150\u0152\u00baM added) on local Zostera marina L. SGD rates varied from essentially 0 to 16.7\u00ac\u00b122.4 cm\/day. Results from the mesocosm experiment indicate that Z. marina under nitrate enrichment performs differently than those under control conditions. Under 30\u0152\u00baM enrichment, photosynthetic capacity increased, while it decreased under 150\u0152\u00baM.","4056":"An understanding of the ecology and life history of juvenile organisms is crucial for understanding these aspects of the adult organism. Intertidal bivalves rely on the successful settlement of larvae and the survival and growth of juveniles. Determining the distribution of juvenile bivalves is important for understanding the distribution and predicting the presence of adult bivalves, for both ecological and commercial reasons. Measuring growth rates and mortality of juvenile bivalves can shed light on what is necessary to carry a juvenile bivalve through adulthood. I surveyed several sites in the San Juan Islands, WA, recording sediment type, tidal height, beach slopes and wave exposures to determine the abundance of juveniles at these sites and what factors can be used as indicators of juvenile presence. I found that surface granules, surface mud, beach slope and subsurface shell hash were correlated with patterns observed in clam assemblages. It also appears that a particular site is a better predictor of clam assemblages and physical features than tidal height. I also tested the response of several species of intertidal clams\u201a\u00c4\u00eeTresus capax, Saxidomus giganteus, Macoma spp., Protothaca staminea, Venerupis philippinarium and Mya arenaria\u201a\u00c4\u00eeto increased sediment temperatures during low-tide of different lengths. I found that growth increased in ideal conditions from species that live lowest in the intertidal to those that live in the high intertidal. Mortality in elevated temperatures increased with decreasing intertidal elevation. Effects of predation were also tested\u201a\u00c4\u00eeHemigrapsus nudus and Cancer productus were found to prey on juvenile Macoma spp. H. nudus\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s preference between Macoma spp. and Ulva depended on previous experience handling clams.","4057":"Phenotypic plasticity is one mechanism by intertidal organisms to change and survive in a variety of local flow environments. One such species is the barnacle Balanus glandula, which exhibits plasticity in both its feeding behavior and the morphology of its feeding cirri. Barnacles feed actively at low flow speeds, but can feed passively at higher flow speeds. Additionally, individuals in habitually low flow environments have longer and thinner cirri than barnacles in high flow environments. This study explores how behavioral and morphological plasticity interact to give barnacles from low flow environments an advantage while feeding at slower water velocities. Using a flow tank to observe feeding behavior, barnacles were placed in flows ranging from 0 to 10 cm\/sec. Barnacles from a low flow site employed passive feeding at lower water velocities than barnacles from a high flow site. Passive feeding, when possible, is thought to increase the energetic efficiency of feeding compared to active feeding. In slower water velocities, the increased ability to feed passively benefits low flow barnacles compared to high flow barnacles.","4058":"The ray-finned fish family Gobiesocidae includes over 100 species of fish that are commonly known as clingfish (Fishbase). These aptly named clingfish posses modified pelvic fins that are fused into a biological suction cup, allowing the fish to adhere to surfaces in their environments. The northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus, is a common inhabitant of the rocky intertidal shores along the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. The northern clingfish can reach sizes up to 16cm but are much more common around 8-10cm (Fishbase). These clingfish use their suction discs to adhere to rocks in their intertidal home, providing a way to remain stationary and stable in the turbulent waters close to shore. Although intertidal rocks differ greatly in surface roughness, we have observed that the northern clingfish does not appear to be limited to only smooth rocks. While manufactured suction cups function only on smooth surfaces, clingfish appear able to stick on the myriad types of surfaces present in the intertidal. This study seeks to compare how well clingfish are able to adhere to surfaces of different roughness.","4059":"The toxin-producing diatom Pseudo-nitzshcia has been monitored in a bloom for the last three years (2009-2011) in East Sound, WA. To expand the understanding of the dynamics of toxin production, especially in response to climate change and ocean acidification, two additional studies were conducted, including an ocean acidification mesocosm, and a laboratory growth experiment using low pH and low Silica conditions. Results from the mesocosm experiment were inconclusive. The Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries cultures grown in the laboratory were grown under low pH and low silica conditions. The pH was controlled by adding CO2 saturated water to the cultures, instead of HCl, which has been previously done by other studies. Growth of P. multiseries was unaffected by low pH, and was negatively affected by silica limitation.","4060":"Zooplankton in Cattle Pass are advected from two water sources. Water from the Juan de Fuca Strait enters the pass from the South during flooding tides, while water from the Strait of Georgia enters from the North during ebbing tides. The questions I am interested in answering are: how does the marine influence of the Juan de Fuca Strait and the estuarine influence the Strait of Georgia affect the abundance of zooplankton in Cattle Pass? Do tidal processes affect the abundances of zooplankton in Cattle Pass? Is zooplankton abundance correlated with upper trophic level foraging? I based my hypothesis on several assumptions based on conclusions of a study from 1995 to 1997 by Zamon: water density fluctuations in San Juan Channel are evidence that tidal currents affect the source from which plankton is derived. Flooding tides mix colder, saltier water from Juan de Fuca into San Juan Channel. Tides create predictable patters of zooplankton availability for planktivorous animals (Zamon 2000). I hypothesized that ebbing tides advect zooplankton from the Juan de Fuca Strait. Zooplankton will be more numerous in the more oceanic waters during flood tide. I tested this hypothesis by analyzing zooplankton tows collected during flooding and ebbing tides.","4061":"Ascidians and vertebrates share very similar chordate characteristics during their developmental stages. Since both lineages have highly conserved genomes we are able to make evolutionary comparisons between the two subphyla at the genome level (Dehal et al, 2002). By further exploring metamorphosis in the ascidians, we may be able to develop insight into the evolution of their unusual adult body plan.","4062":"Typical chordate features found in ascidian tadpole larvae have been evolutionarily lost several times independently within the Molgulidae family. While tailed molgulids retain a tail with muscle cells, a notochord, and a dorsal neural tube, the notochord and muscle cells have been lost within the tailless species. A locus containing an unusual gene arrangement of the Bobcat gene within the first intron of the Manx gene has been shown to be essential for the development of chordate features in molgulid tadpole larvae. Sequencing and closer examination of ascidian genomes show that there is a unique gene arrangement of SSNA1 upstream and adjacent to Manx and Bobcat within the Molgulidae which is not found in cionid ascidians; however, a similar arrangement of SSNA1 directly upstream of Bobcat was found in Oikopleura dioica supporting Appendicularia as a sister group to the Molgulidae. SSNA1 is expressed in tailed Molgula oculata gonads and not in tailless M. occulta gonads, suggesting SSNA1 could have a role in the development of tailed larvae. Expression of these key genes could be affected by one another\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s close proximity, disturbing normal gene expression and thereby larval development of chordate features. We propose that the rearrangement that took place in the molgulid ancestor may be contributing to the numerous instances of the evolution of taillessness found in the Molgulidae.","4063":"Ascidians and vertebrates share very similar chordate characteristics during their developmental stages.

Kelps also make up a high amount of biomass and provide structure and habitat to many organisms. However, little kelp biomass is directly consumed. However, its biomass is transported via a spatial subsidy. This spatial subsidy links near-shore primary production with comparatively deep water primary consumers. One such consumer is the red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. Urchins are known to feed on kelps transported by the spatial subsidy. These drift kelps may spend weeks drifting and degrading before they are encountered by an urchin. There has been little research on how the degradation or aging of kelps has on palatability to urchins. This study tests the feeding preference of red urchins to three species of kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana, Agarum fimbriatum, Saccharina subsimplex) that were both fresh and aged with the hope of gaining insight to how kelps move through the spatial subsidy. We also investigated how phlorotannin content changes as kelp age. Some research suggests that phlorotannins act as herbivory deterrent and that as kelp age they lose their phlorotannins. We found that Nereocystis luetkeana was the most preferred kelp species and that fresh kelps were preferred over aged ones. Analysis of phlorotannin content showed that there is a difference between species in phlorotannin content but the data suggests that there is little to no change through time. Further analysis indicated that urchins can detect the differences between kelps. This may mean that urchins act as a biological filter to detrital kelps as they are moved through the spatial subsidy and integrated into the food web.","4065":"In this study, I aimed to test whether raising Dendraster excentricus larvae developing in different salinities differ in blastocoel volume. I used two salinity Timm (2011) 3 treatments: salinity approximately 3\u201a\u00c4\u221e higher than that of sea water from Friday Harbor, WA, and salinity approximately 3\u201a\u00c4\u221e lower than that of sea water from Friday Harbor, WA. Prior to direct observations, I modeled a suite of larval shapes, blastocoel volumes, and densities, predicting the effects of these features on larval swimming. Results of the models indicated that water density affected swimming, and that altering blastocoel density compensated for these effects. Using this information, I was able to narrow down physically feasible blastocoel volumes and fluid densities, which helped shape my hypotheses. My hypotheses were further shaped by the natural history of D. excentricus larvae: In the earliest stages of the larva, the blastocoel is anteriorly located. This means that the fluid within the blastocoel should be less dense than the larval body in order to ensure correct orientation. Based on the models, I hypothesized that there would exist a direct correlation between the rearing salinity and the larvae\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s internal density. Based on the developmental process, I further postulated that larval blastocoel volume would increase as rearing salinity decreased.","4066":"Global climate change impacts, including increasing frequency of extreme climatic events and elevated aerial and aquatic temperatures, are predicted to substantially affect organisms, ecosystems, and ecological communities. Species interactions\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 are fundamental drivers of ecosystem and community dynamics. Comprehensive climate change assessments demand consideration of both the role of species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 interactions in communities, and modulation of body temperature and thus thermal stress impacts via organism morphology and mobility. Sharp environmental stress gradients and a gradient of emersion time make the rocky intertidal a model system for studying the effects of climate change on communities. In this study we manipulated low-tide aerial temperature to test the predicted effects of climate change on the interactions between a motile predator, the gastropod Nucella ostrina, and its sessile prey, the barnacle Balanus glandula. Nucella ostrina, exhibits periodicity in foraging on Balanus glandula, with maximum foraging occurring during periods of nighttime exposure. Subjecting Nucella to chronic and acute aerial temperature manipulations did not alter the timing or magnitude of a previously documented foraging bout, though asynchrony in the feeding of males and females was observed. Movement of Nucella away from food during low tide exceeded initiation of feeding independent of aerial temperature, suggesting behavioral refuge. Sex specific trends in movement may be the effect of different energetic costs for production of eggs and sperm. These results suggest thermal stress affects male and female Nucella differently, but does not disrupt the tide- specific timing of foraging bouts.","4067":"There is huge variation in vertebral centra morphology both within and among classes. While research has noted and described these differences in detail, it has not adequately explored how centrum shape affects joint stiffness. My research explored how the existing variation between fish and mammal vertebral centra affects the loading and deflection of the intervertebral joint under homologous conditions of size and materials. I expected that bending forces would be proportionally related to the volume of intervertebral material as affected by intervertebral distance and centra morphology. To test the stiffness of the joint, I made multiple motion segments of ABS plastic using silicone as the intervertebral material. Each centrum had a different angle of concavity, flat face, or convexity mimicking fish, land mammals and marine mammals, respectively. The Material Testing System deflected the motion segment measuring the force required at the end of a moment arm. Land and aquatic mammals create statistically similar bending moments that are distinct from all of the fish inspired designs, which are all statistically similar to each other. The trends within these findings raise more questions about how concavity and intervertebral length affect stiffness, stress, moment, and overall bending performance with biomechanic and evolutionary implications.","4068":"Mussels attach to substrates by means of byssal threads. The amount of threads produced influences the strength of attachment. In this experiment, we looked at the effect of temperature on the number of byssal threads formed by the marine mussel species Mytilus trossulus. We predicted that higher temperatures would limit the number of byssal threads produced. Mussels were placed in a flume set to a controlled temperature for each trial. Trials were performed at 10, 14, 18, 20, 22 and 25 degrees Celsius. Threads produced by each mussel were counted 11 times over a 24 hour period. Scanning electron microscope photos were also taken of threads from each temperature to compare possible visual differences. Our results suggest that total mean threads produced by M. trossulus peak around 18 degrees Celsius, and decrease as temperatures increase or decrease. The importance of knowledge on factors that affect byssal thread formation becomes increasingly important as global water temperature is expected to rise. Mussel attachment is important for ecological reasons, because mussels and the ecosystem that they live in depend on the formation of thick mussel beds. This information is also useful for mussel aquaculture, as the raising of farmed mussels depends on the ability of mussels to attach to substrates.","4069":"The objective of the study was to better understand functional implications of the interaction between tooth morphology and prey handling in durophagous predators. Our goal was to identify an optimal prey orientation and tooth shape combination that requires the least amount of force to crack hard-shelled prey. Amount of force represents the energy a durophagous predator expends to crack its prey. We modeled the crushing interaction between two sets of tooth models and two Nucella sp. snail shell orientations. Tooth models were grouped into a set that ranges from a convex to concave occlusal surface, and set that has a central cusp with a variable radius. Snail shell orientations included an upside down position, such that the aperture was facing up; and a right-side-up position, such that the aperature was facing down. We found that it took the least total force to crush the shell in its upside down position. At this point of the shell, tight whorls have not formed to strengthen the shell as they have on the upper surface, closer to the shell\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s apex, where the aperature is facing down. We also found that as convexity of the tooth increased, the force needed to crack the shell decreased. Finally, we found that as the cusp radius decreased, or as the tooth becomes sharper, the force needed to break the prey item decreased. These results reveal that form and function of tooth shape determine how predators expend energy for prey handling, which affects how predator-prey relationships evolve through space and time. Some durophagous predators may have evolved sharper, more convex tooth morphology to crush hard-shelled prey in preferred orientations.","4070":"Predator prey interactions, specifically predation acts, were observed and recorded to better understand trophic level interactions and community ecology in the San Juan Islands. We looked at predation between Pandalus danae and predators such as Sebastes caurinus and Sebastes malige. Using a tethering method we attached Pandalus danae to frames and deployed them at high and low rockfish concentrated sites in the San Juan Islands. We observed predator prey interactions using a GoPro underwater camera set to time lapse photography which provided us with information on shrimp predators and showed that our method was successful.","4071":"Morphological and mechanical features of crab claws reflect their functions and prey selections. This study focuses on the phylogenetic dentition patterns of crabs and the impacts it has on prey consumption. Pictures of crab carapace and the right claw were imported to Image J to measure aspect ratio, radius of curvature, propus length, and denticle position for each denticle as well as the carapace length. Generalist species such as Oregonia gracilis tend to have a smaller radius of curvature and a larger aspect ratio. The specialists\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 species such as Pugettia richii, Pugettia gracilis, Pugettia producta, Metacarcinus magister, Cancer productus, Cancer oregonensis, Telmessus cheiragonus, Scyra acutifrons, and Hemigrapsus nudus have a larger radius of curvature and a smaller aspect ratio. Generalist species commonly eat small soft marine organisms and macro algae, while the specialist species consume hard-shelled prey, such as barnacles, clams, snails, etc. Most specialist species have wider, blunter denticles at the fulcrum and become narrower, sharper towards the tip. The mechanical advantages for these crab species comes from the tip of the claw; allowing them to crush their prey. Generalist species have sharper, narrower teeth from the fulcrum to the tip of the claw. These crabs do not use their claws for crushing, but more for shredding. Denticle position and mechanical advantages heavily impact the dietary and foraging behaviors of the crabs studied. The data collected from this research could potentially jump start research on crab dentition. By understanding the use of crab denticles, we will have a greater advantage to studying crab foraging behaviors and denticle morphologies.","4072":"Detritus is a vital source of nutrients for many benthic organisms, but its composition and dynamics in the ocean are relatively unstudied. Sea urchin feces may provide an important link from the relatively shallow benthic areas to other benthic communities, such as those in the deep-sea, as urchin \u201a\u00c4\u00famobs\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 are capable of mowing down entire forests of algae and, of that algae, their digestive systems absorb on average only 60% of the calories available. Through these relatively unprocessed feces, a large amount of material could be available to benthic communities, making the feces a potentially vitally important nutrient conveyer to benthic organisms. To gain insight into the composition of urchin feces, and more insight into their digestive system, I conducted a series of tests on the caloric content of algae and urchin feces. First, I tested two species of algae at various stages of decay for caloric content. Then, I tested aged and fresh feces of 12 urchins on diets of either Nereocystis luetkeana (Nereocystis), or Agarum fimbriatum, for caloric content using a modified version of a micro assay technique. I found that aging dramatically increases the caloric values of both Nereocystis feces and tissue samples, however in agarum feces and tissue samples aging has little effect. This could have significant implications in considering where benthic organisms acquire their nutrients, as well as the importance of sea urchins in providing a link to those organisms.","4073":"Zooplankton in Cattle Pass are advected from two water sources. Water from the Juan de Fuca Strait enters the pass from the South during flooding tides, while water from the Strait of Georgia enters from the North during ebbing tides. The questions I am interested in answering are: how does the marine influence of the Juan de Fuca Strait and the estuarine influence of the Strait of Georgia affect the abundance of zooplankton in Cattle Pass? Do tidal processes affect the abundances of zooplankton in Cattle Pass? Is zooplankton abundance correlated with upper trophic level foraging? I based my hypothesis on several assumptions based on conclusions of a study from 1995 to 1997 by Zamon: water density fluctuations in San Juan Channel are evidence that tidal currents affect the source from which plankton is derived. Flooding tides mix colder, saltier water from Juan de Fuca into San Juan Channel. Tides create predictable patterns of zooplankton availability for planktivorous animals (Zamon 2000). I hypothesized that ebbing tides advect zooplankton from the Strait of Georgia while flooding tides advect zooplankton from the Juan de Fuca Strait. Zooplankton will be more numerous in the more oceanic waters during flood tide. I tested this hypothesis by analyzing zooplankton tows collected during flooding and ebbing tides.","4074":"Trophic cascades have been shown to completely alter marine communities, especially after the collapse of an important fishery. It is therefore important to understand trophic relationships between marine organisms in order to prevent the drastic change of ecosystem structures due to anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing. In the Salish Sea, rockfish, Sebastes caurinus and Sebastes maliger, are an important predatory fish that have been in decline in past years. In order to understand the predator-prey interactions of rockfish in the San Juan Islands, we used prey tethering techniques, to assess relative rates of predation on shrimp and how much predation is occurring from rockfish. Coon-stripe shrimp, Pandalus danae, were tethered and attached to a frame that was deployed at two sites with different rockfish abundance. A camera was also deployed in order to record video footage of predation. Our method of tethering was successful, showing 100% predation in deployments longer than 18 hours and capturing video footage during the day without the use of an artificial light. Various predators were observed in video data from each site. We recommend that this method be used to assess the rockfish and shrimp relationship in the San Juan Islands and suggest expanding this study to include multiple trials throughout various seasons.","4075":"Mussels attach themselves to hard substrates by extruding thin, strong, and flexible hair- like attachments known as byssal threads, which are anchored in place with small adhesive plaques. While many studies have examined how multiple abiotic variables affect mussel attachment strength, few have performed extensive single variable tests within a controlled lab setting. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature on byssus production in the native Northern Pacific intertidal blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus, and expected to see a decline in production with increasing temperatures (specifically, between 18\u00ac\u221eC-25\u00ac\u221eC). We also hypothesized that threads produced in warmer temperatures would show a visual decline in quality, either through thinning, degradation, or tearing. Mussels were placed in a temperature controlled flume for 24 hours. Six different trials were run at 10\u00ac\u221eC, 14\u00ac\u221eC, 18\u00ac\u221eC, 20\u00ac\u221eC, 22\u00ac\u221eC, and 25\u00ac\u221eC. Byssal threads were counted for the duration of each trial to determine production and rate of attachment. Threads produced under these different temperature regimes were analyzed under an SEM to visually compare differences in quality. Overall, there was a significantly negative correlation between thread production and increases in temperature, with the highest amount occurring at 18\u00ac\u221eC (11.25 threads +2.0 s.e.m.) and the lowest at 25\u00ac\u221eC (0 threads). Acclimatization and rate of thread production was also negatively affected by temperature increases. In addition, we saw a significant difference in percentage of mussel attachment between temperatures, with up to 93% attached in the 10\u00ac\u221eC and 18\u00ac\u221eC treatments and 50-0% in the 20\u00ac\u221eC-25\u00ac\u221eC treatments. However, visual analyses of thread quality differences were inconclusive. Our findings indicate that climatic temperature increases may negatively affect both the range of M. trossulus within Northern Pacific rocky intertidal zones as well as economically setback the aquaculture of the speciess.","4076":"Decapod crustaceans, specifically crabs, use specialized feeding appendages called chelae for a range of functions, the foremost of which is prey capture and handling. The gross morphology of the chelae and denticles, the tooth-like structures along the pincher fingers, may provide information about prey selection and foraging behavior. We measured the aspect ratio (height\/width) and radius of curvature (radius of the tooth tip) of the denticles on the chelae of Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. Our specimens were collected from Friday Harbor in the San Juan Islands, Washington and varied in size from 6-21 cm carapace length. We examined denticle morphological changes in an ontogenetic series as well as along the length of the immobile finger, propus. We found that as M. magister matures, their denticles became overall taller and pointier as represented by higher aspect ratio morphology. Variation in denticle morphology in the ontogenetic series appears to be directly related to shifts in diet with age. Along the propus length, denticles were broad and molariform in the center and more pointed nearest the fulcrum and tip. The layout of various shaped denticles along the propus indicates that both crushing as well as peeling or piercing feeding techniques are used by M. magister. This study prompts further research into the effect of predatory feeding appendages on prey populations and morphologies.","4077":"Potential effects of changing body shape morphometrics with growth in bulbous fishes were studied in five species; Clinocottus globiceps, Oligocottus maculosus, Liparis dennyi and Gobiesox maeandricus and Chitonotus pugetensis, all found and collected in the Salish Sea, Washington. For each species there was a size range that attempted to encompass juvenile to adult forms. We evaluated the standard length, body width and body depth along the length of the body of each individual. To understand how body streamlining and structural stiffness change with growth we calculated second moment of area and aspect ratio. We found a significant correlation between ontogeny and change in body shape and stiffness. As these fish grow in length they become more streamlined along the body and increase stiffness of their wide heads. Changing body morphometrics with growth have important implications about fish\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s swimming performance, predator avoidance, obtaining food and maneuvering within their habitat.","4078":"The objective of this study was to examine the body morphology of a variety of Scorpaeniform fishes in the Salish Sea in order to better understand how body shape and body stiffness change along a fish\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s body and how they differ between closely related families of marine fishes in the same geographic location. Images were taken of 24 species in six families of Cottoidei fishes. Second moment of area, aspect ratio and fineness ratio were calculated and compared among families. Psychrolutidae had a significantly higher second moment of area than the other five families, and there were no significant differences among families for fineness ratio. Aspect ratios varied greatly among families with Psychrolutidae and Rhamphocottidae having the highest ratios, followed by Cottidae, Hemitripteridae and Liparidae, with Agonidae showing the lowest ratios. These results imply that ecology may be a better determinant in body shape and stiffness than evolution, as these closely related families showed significant variation among one another.","4079":"Seabirds play important ecological roles and are indicators of ecosystem health and change. They are thought to be in decline in the Salish Sea. Seabirds were counted in San Juan Channel during fall 2012. This study focuses on the community composition as well as the distribution and within-season change among the dominant families. Fall 2012 was compared to data from previous years going back to 2006 to assess community stability and changes in abundance and found no evidence of continued decline in San Juan Channel.","4080":"In the San Juan Islands, the immediate trophic levels of the marine food web represent a critical link that is largely constituted by forage fish, including the Pacific Sand Lance. This document contains the results of an in-depth study of the morphological and conditional differences between Pacific Sand Lance populations at different depths. Beach seines were used to retrieve fish from shallow water (Jackson Beach), and Van Veen grabs were used to sample from deep water (the San Juan channel wave field). The fish observed at the wave field were larger and heavier than those at Jackson Beach, both across the season and on a discrete, week- by-week scale. There was a slight disparity in hibernation periods between depth populations. In the wave field, most of the fish at that site began hibernating during the second half of October as interpreted from the stomach fullness of fish. In contrast, the majority of the fish at Jackson Beach began hibernating two weeks earlier, during the first half of October. Finally, the dietary analyses of both sites suggested multiple hypotheses of life histories, including that the Pacific Sand Lance are selective feeders, and that their preferences vary with age.","4081":"The seasonal dynamics of trophic interactions in diatoms, calanoid copepods, and Pacific sand lance in the San Juan Channel were examined over the fall season. There was a very large diatom bloom on October 10th (118,707.53 diatoms L-1) after which density remained low. Calanoid copepod density also peaked on the 10th (5,159.31 individuals m-3) then decreased with slight fluctuations. Nauplii decreased in abundance during the season, especially relative to adult calanoids, probably due to their life history pattern which favors development to copepodite stage V before over-wintering diapause. Lipid reserves in calanoid copepods increased immediately following the diatom bloom, then remained low the rest of the season. The greatest percent of sand lance with calanoids in their stomachs (23.1%) was found before the plankton blooms. It is suggested that this may be because they begin hibernation without regard to a fall bloom, since fall bloom timing is very inconsistent. Overall, a temporal linkage in trophic dynamics was evident between primary and secondary productivity, but not between the plankton and sand lance. Sampling the sand lance feeding in the water column would strengthen further evaluation of sand lance trophic interactions with diatoms and copepods.","4082":"The main driver of ecosystem processes in northern coastal ecosystems is tidal current. Previous Pelagic Ecosystems Functions projects have examined relationships of tidal current throughout the channel, but they were not able to document and quantify temporal patterns. My objective was to investigate the fine scale temporal changes of physical and biological factors over a flooding tide through repeated sampling over a short temporal scale. I did this through sampling water masses and seabird abundance. Oceanography results indicated sampling water masses on a fine temporal scale can reveal previously undetected inputs and tidal patterns. Seabird results showed strong temporal patterns in abundance in response to tidal phase in overall abundance and on the species level. These results suggest fine temporal scale sampling can quantify patterns in seabird response to tidal phase that could be used to calibrate coarse scale sampling methods. Based on these results, I suggest fine temporal scale sampling be used in future studies to determine tidal relationships between seabirds and tides.","4083":"Nereocystis creates floating debris when broken from the bottom. With currents and wind this flotsam on occasion entangles to form a raft of Nereocystis. Rafting Nereocystis floats throughout the San Juan Islands channels. Here I report the results of surveys and trial studies conducted to study the movement, composition, fauna, density of rafts in channel, and human waste, associated with kelp rafts in San Juan channel. The measurements and collections for the studies utilized snorkeling and SCUBA diving equipment. Transect surveys the R.V centennial on its weekly pelagic ecosystem function cruise. Nereocystis kelp rafts and other flotsam is a relatively unstudied subject. My aims in this study included determining the relationships in the pelagic ecosystem with which Nereocystis rafts overlap; whether forage fish aggregate or use the raft as a feeding area; and whether predators attract to rafts. Nereocystis rafts are a refuge for benthic organisms in a pelagic environment.","4084":"Copepods are a highly important group of organisms to local and global ecosystems and carbon cycles. By linking trophic levels and exporting production, copepods have great cumulative effect on the fate of biogenic carbon and energy. Copepod abundance across fall 2012 was measured at two stations in the San Juan archipelago, WA, a highly productive and tidally complex region. Using these data and past measurements from the University of Washington\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Pelagic Ecosystem Function research apprenticeship, a pattern was shown linking higher-than-average copepod abundance with sampling that followed a flood tide. Tidal currents seem to interact with complex shallow bathymetric features near stations in the north and south end of San Juan Channel to create areas of high copepod abundance following flooding tides. These patterns suggest mechanisms influencing aggregations of animals in higher trophic levels (fish, seabirds, mammals).","4085":"The San Juan Archipelago is a dynamic cluster of islands supporting seven species of cetaceans including the harbor and dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s porpoises. Under recognized in the San Juan Archipelago conservation and better management of these species are required. Harbor porpoises were seen in higher densities than dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s porpoises concurrent with past data. Supported by the habitat preference of each species. Densities of harbor porpoises were highest in the central part of the San Juan Channel and densities of dall\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s porpoises were not a regular pattern observed. The bathymetry in this section (3 and 4) described by a sudden change from deep (~ 165 m) to shallow (~70 m) water depth effects turbulent mixing and prey aggregation dependent on current speed and direction. Harbor porpoise densities changed considerably due to this effect. Harbor porpoises densities changed when considering tidal factors. Highest densities of harbor porpoises were counted during fast flood (3.02\/km2) and fast ebb (1.75\/km2). Increased density with increased current speed was observed over 67% of cruise days.","4086":"In the San Juan Archipelago two species of pinnipeds are abundant: Phoca vitulina, the harbor seal, and Eumetopias jubatus, the Steller sea lion. This study focused on the pelagic environment where pinnipeds are believed to be feeding. The strip transect method was used on both large and fine scales to determine the effects of tides and bathymetry on pinniped abundance and distribution. Populations have been stable for the past eight years for both species in the channel. Harbor seals were found throughout the channel, but distributional patterns changed on coarse scales. Steller sea lions were concentrated in the southern part of the channel in close proximity to their haul out site. Fine spatial and temporal transects showed little correlation between harbor seals and tidal phase or bathymetry. Steller sea lions were present in the water during faster currents, especially with floods. They also showed a relationship with the bathymetric effect. This study will allow for further research on the relationship of pinnipeds and tides.","4087":"Forage fish such as herring, surf perch and Pacific sand lance are a crucial link between lower and upper elements in the food chain, transferring dense energy and vitamin content from primary producers (phytoplankton) to higher trophic levels (piscivorous fishes, birds, and marine mammals). In this study we examined the feeding ecology and trophic role of A. hexapterus in the San Juan Archipelago. We collected data on mass, fork length, population structure, substrate, and stomach contents and used a chi-square test to examine whether or not there were differences in fullness and digestion as a function diel, tidal and seasonal cycles. Our results suggest that time of day has a significant influence on stomach fullness (X2 =16.01, P=0.042), but not digestion. Date also significantly drives patterns in stomach fullness (X2 =60.57, P=0.019), but not in digestion. We used a generalized linear model to account for the corresponding effects of tidal, diel, and seasonal trends as well as difference in habitat affinity for different substrates in driving patterns of catch per unit effort (CPUE). CPUE was significantly different across the course of the fall (F1= 3.00, p=0.093) and in different substrate types (F1= 12.49, p=0.001). This study can be used to inform fisheries managers and add higher resolution to food web models.","4088":"In the pelagic zone Ammodytes hexapterus or the Pacific Sand lance (PSL) act as an important link in the food web feeding on planktons and being preyed on by a wide variety of higher trophic level predators (Martin et al., 1999). The San Juan Archipelago (SJA) offers a diverse, productive and tidally dynamic ecosystem for PSL to inhabit. Sand wave fields are thought to be a major habitat for PSL in the SJA. Sand waves are bed forms present under flow velocities of 0.5 to 1.0 m\/s and grain size of 0.25 -2.0mm in diameter (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008). Understanding how benthic substrate will shape sand lance distribution on the wave fields is critical to further understanding the life history, daily migrations and consequently the role PSL play in the pelagic environment. Understanding how fish densities change with differences with substrate, how fish size change with substrate and how does substrate change over the sand wave are important steps towards further answering questions about the life history and populations of the PSL. These questions were addressed by obtaining sediment samples from the San Juan channel sand wave field and fractioning out sediment size, measuring PSL densities and sizes in the samples. PSL preferred low gravel high sand concentrations. Sand lance densities were highest in high concentrations of sand which corresponded to the middle of the wave field.","4089":"Situated between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia, the San Juan Channel exists as a complex, dynamic, highly productive estuarine ecosystem\u201a\u00c4\u00eereceiving oceanic input from the south and freshwater input from the north, respectively. Phytoplankton are highly important to marine ecosystems and studying the interactions between these organisms and the changing physical oceanographic environment is becoming increasingly important\u201a\u00c4\u00eeespecially in regions of high biological productivity such as the San Juan Channel. Stemming from the decided importance of these interactions, the purpose of this study was to build on our understanding of patterns and drivers of variation in the physical oceanography of the region\u201a\u00c4\u00eewith a specific focus on oxygen and chlorophyll. We utilized measurements of temperature, salinity, density, chlorophyll fluorescence, and dissolved oxygen over the water column to assess variation both within fall 2012 and among fall data from 2004 to 2012. Correlations between density, chlorophyll, and oxygen were observed during fall 2012 and oceanic intrusions were seen as far as the north station\u201a\u00c4\u00eeprior to the fall transition such intrusions were hypoxic and, presumably, had high CO2 concentrations as well. An observed correlation proposed in 2011 and verified with these data between pycnocline variation and tidal height allows for the quantification of such intrusions. Comparison of the interannual data displayed unprecedentedly high levels of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen, found during fall 2012. Analysis of the full data set revealed covariance of some variables, such as deep oxygen and temperature, as well as the influence of potential driving factors, such as tides, oceanic input, and Fraser River flow, on the pattern of interannual variation.","4090":"Peak stress and stiffness of skin from two elongate fishes, Apodichthys flavidus and Eptatretus stoutii, were mechanically tested at 25mm\/minute. Quasi-static tension tests to failure were conducted on skin from dorsal samples from the anterior and posterior ends. Both hagfish and gunnel skin show anisotropy in opposite trends. Hagfish have more deformation resistance longitudinally and gunnels show more resistance circumferentially. Location of samples did not have a significant difference for measurements of either property for both fish. Stiffness exhibited a significant difference for both species between the different directions.","4091":"Sponges (phylum Porifera) fall short of being considered true animals, Eumetazoas, because of their unique tissue organization. This organization is questionability multicellular because of their cell-to-cell nutrient transfer and lack of epithelialization. Sponge cells have, however, been shown to have cell to cell communication and recognition within an individual. To assess the degree of a sponge\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to act as a coherent metazoan organism by recognizing and repairing damage to a specific area, three morphologically different demosponge sponges of the species Halochondria panicea, Phakellia sp. and Mycale sp. were wounded and monitored. Both growth and regeneration were evaluated by observing surface area of growth per unit time with regards to overall percent area change and oscula formation respectively in the field over an 18-day period by time series photographs and analyzed with ImageJ software. The individuals of the Phakellia sp. could not display results due to environmental disturbance. The intertidal encrusting sponges, Mycale sp., Halochondria panicea, both showed signs of overall growth in the wounded region without a statistical difference between the two species (P=0.877). The new outside growth rate of the entire sponge opposed to healing growth rate of the wounded region in both sponge species also proved to be statistically insignificant (Halochondria panacea P=0.114 and Mycale sp. P=0.343). Regeneration by oscula formation was observed in both encrusting species after day two for Mycale sp. and by day 10 in Halochondria panicea. These results further show that growth and regeneration in a specific wounded region may be an adaptation to remain a specific shape for the entire sponge individual as well as to maintain survival in a competitive environment such as the intertidal.","4092":"Global ocean acidification caused by an increase in absorbed CO2 is changing oceanic ecology world wide, however little is known on how this change will effect medusozoan Cnidarians (jellyfish). Many studies have predicted that lower pH may be causing an increase in the abundance of jellyfish, however many more have refuted these results. Jellyfish are predators of epipelagic crustaceans and compete with fish for prey. A change in jellyfish population or feeding behavior may affect the entire pelagic ecosystem. This project aims to investigate the relationship between feeding rate of jellyfish Mitrocoma cellularia on crustacean prey Artemia spp., under variable seawater CO2 concentrations: ambient local seawater (about 700ppm), 400 ppm and 950 ppm. Feeding rates of M. cellularia were calculated and compared with those of Aequorea victoria under local seawater conditions and the feeding rate of A. victoria under CO2 treated saltwater conditions was calculated. It was found that M. cellularia had a faster feeding rate than A. victoria in ambient conditions (p=0.042). No significant difference was found among the feeding rates under the three water treatments (p= 0.297) however a slight trend of increasing feeding rate was observed as pH decreased. To understand how Ocean acidification affects medusozoan Cnidarians more refined methods are needed as well as an increase in trials.","4093":"Climate change can have a gradual affect on organism interactions gradually in the marine ecosystem which varies in many factors such as temperature. Temperature can alter the feeding habits of marine invertebrates such as bryozoans. There are no known studies on the effects of temperature on the feeding activity of algae by bryozoan (Membranipora membranacea and Dendrobeania lichenoides) colonies found at Friday Harbor, WA. The aim is to study the effects of temperature on bryozoan feeding on algae. Bryozoan colonies (n=10 of each species per treatment) were exposed to three different temperature treatments, 9 \u00ac\u222bC, 12 \u00ac\u222bC, and 15 \u00ac\u222bC. In this study, these species were fed with a 1 to 200 ratio of phytoplankton, Isochrysis sp, and 0.22 \u0152\u00bam filtered seawater. The results were inconclusive because the controls were not significantly different from the treatments. This study could have determined the impact of climate change on bryozoans as well as other sessile organisms.","4094":"Sea stars typically live with their oral side facing the substratum, and the ability to right themselves when turned over is important response to avoid desiccation and predation. The righting time of 8 species of sea stars; Henricia leviuscula (3 color variations), Henricia pumila sp. nov., Leptasterias hexactis, Pyconopodia helianthoides, Pisaster ochraceus, and Pteraster tesselatus were tested on two different substrata to determine if it affects righting time. The righting times were measured when sea stars were placed with their aboral side on the substratum in two different tanks, one covered with sand and another with no sediment. Since podia adhesion to the substratum is required for a sea star to right itself, it was expected that substrata with a smaller grain size would cause an increase in righting time compared to a flatter surface. Sea star diameter was measured to determine the correlation between size and righting time. Leading arm identification was also observed to test the initiating arm preference. P. tesselatus was the only species that was unable to right itself in sand. In most species, sand increased the average righting time compared to other substrata. Individuals with a larger diameter were found to have an increased righting time. No significant relationship was found to which arm initiated the response in all individuals. This study helps to add to the minimal knowledge of this unusual behavior of echinoderms.","4095":"Individuals of the aggregating anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima, occupy the rocky intertidal and form large clusters of polyps by splitting (fission). These organisms are known to attack neighboring, unrelated clone-groups and although genetically identical, fighting ability varies within a clone-group; individuals on the edge of the aggregation take the role of warriors, leaving those further inside the clone-group free to reproduce. This study examined morphological differences between successful and unsuccessful combatants, both within a colony and across different clone-groups. This may confer a competitive advantage to individuals within a colony or to the clone-group as a whole. Anemones were collected from three distinctly separate clonal colonies in a single bay and agonistic interclonal interactions were staged. Competitors were chosen at random within each functional class, with 15 reproducer and 15 warrior trials. Outcomes of the competitions were determined and variations in tentacle length, tentacle density and acrorhagi density were assessed between the winners and losers, as well as within clone-groups. Warriors and reproducers from Clone-group 1 had the highest frequency of wins, while individuals from Clone-group 3 had the least. No differences between tentacle density and acrorhagi density were observed. Tentacle length varied both across clone groups and between warriors and reproducers within colonies (warriors: P &lt; 0.001, reproducers: P =0.004; and clone-group (CG) 1: P =0.001, CG 3: P = 0.003; respectively). Morphological characteristics measured do not appear to give a competitive advantage to individuals (P = 0.262). Aggressive ability seems to be conferred to the aggregation as a whole.","4096":"Filter feeding of microalgae is known to be a source of nutrients in sponges, but the relationship between sponge morphology and filter feeding rates have not been investigated. The demosponges Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae are commonly found in the San Juan Islands, and were used in a comparison study of sponge morphology and filter feeding rates. Sponge samples were collected from two sites, one intertidal and one subtidal, and were treated with a microalgae monoculture of Nannochloropsis. Water samples were taken at regular intervals and measured by spectrophotometer at \u0152\u00aa 440nm for absorbance. Post ANOVA statistical analysis samples from the intertidal site were found to not show any variance within species at any collection point. Specimens from the subtidal site failed to produce conclusive data possibly due to contamination of sponges by other organisms inhabiting the sponges or weakness in the methodology. Therefore, the results of this study conclude that the three species Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae may not have significantly different filter feeding efficiencies even though each species exhibit different morphotypes.","4097":"Fluorescence in marine organisms is a common phenomenon, yet the anatomical structures from which it originates and the behavioral function behind it are not well understood. This study had two distinct purposes; to survey fluorescence in a marine fouling community and to describe inducible fluorescence in two Polychaete species. In the first part of the study, organisms were collected, the fluorescence was photographed, the morphological feature(s) that fluoresced was identified and the wavelength was characterized when possible. The functional morphology of the fluorescent structures was then considered to determine if the fluorescence might have a behavioral purpose, although no clear correlations were found. Eight species in four phyla fluoresced in green, orange and red wavelengths. The second part of the study identified the anatomical source of inducible fluorescence and the stimulus which caused its release in two Polychaete worms, Abarenicola pacifica and Dodecaceria concharum. The fluorescence in A. pacifica was found to be mucus secreted from a pore dorsal to the parapodia during dissection and tactile stimulation. In both A. pacifica and D. concharum, the density of the fluorescence coupled with its secretion without puncture of coelomic cavities or blood vessels suggested it was mucus, although due to optical constraints the anatomical origin in D. concharum could not be determined. Chemosensory cues did not induce either species to release fluorescent material, but tactile stimuli did, including human fingers, shells and predators, suggesting a potential defense mechanism.","4098":"Ocean acidification, the change in ocean chemistry associated with an increase in atmospheric pCO2, is predicted to have harmful impacts on marine life. In this study, I measured the force required to fracture the protective valves of two chiton species (Mopalia muscosa and Mopalia lignosa) after ten days of exposure to control conditions and conditions of raised pCO2. I measured this effect both on valves from freshly sacrificed animals, and on valves that had been dissected prior to treatment. My results show that dissolution of previously dissected valves effects valve strength in M. muscosa, but not in M. lignosa. Both species may compensate for the effects of dissolution in lowered pH treatments by actively depositing more shell material. M. musocsa valves are also, over all treatments, stronger than M. lignosa valves. The variation in baseline strength, and in response to ocean acidification, has implications for the future chiton community in the Northeast Pacific. Additionally, my results call for further research on the physiological tradeoffs of increased shell deposition and the ecological impacts of differential responses to ocean acidification.","4099":"Arthropods are well known for being rampantly speciose. Variation of form and nicheoccupation in arthropods relies on specialized appendages and regionalization of a common bauplan. The specialization of particular body regions leads to displays of sexual dimorphism. Cases of intraspecies morphotypes and sexual dimorphic characters reflect larger trends of morphological variation in all major arthropod clades. Here, I report a morphospace of sexually dimorphic brachyuran crustaceans from the San Juan Islands in the Pacific Northwest and discuss inter- and intraspecies variation as it pertains to marine arthropods as whole. Abdominal shape changes in sexes of Cancer and Hemigrapsus were evaluated using geometric morphometrics and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Traditional morphometrics, measuring the dimensions of the carapace were also incorporated. The abdominal and body shape disparity between genders of both genera is found to be statistically significant through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical comparison test. Sexual dimorphism is not conserved in interspecies or in intraspecies relationships. Hemigrapsus specimens exhibit a higher degree of sexual dimorphism than Cancer specimens. The morphological results reveal ecological effects and macroevolutionary trends resulting from sexual dimorphism of the arthropod bauplan.","4100":"Previous studies on magnetotaxis behavior have found a diverse range of taxa, such as reptiles, birds, and even bacteria, that use magnetite to gather information about their geographic position based on gradients in the earth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s magnetic field. Among the polyplacophorans, it appears that the specific chiton species, Mopalia muscosa (Polyplacophora) also contain magnetite in the lateral teeth of their radula. The purpose of this study is to examine as to whether if magnetite bearing chitons exhibit magnetotactic behavior. This study was conducted in two parts: an artificial ambient magnetic field was manipulated in a laboratory to test for any magnetotactic behavioral responses. Through field observations, we observed the head orientation of chiton (vertical pitch and positional degree) which was documented in their natural habitat. Our artificial ambient magnetic field results indicate differences in head orientation between control group and experimental group and were statistically significant with a p-value &lt;0.02. The chitons\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 heads orientation found in the three outdoor sites were not significantly significant but the mean vector in the raw data plot in each site pointed in the same direction. Our data suggests that chiton have an ability to detect the ambient magnetic field, which can influence their orientation.","4101":"Radula formation in gastropods has been shown to be sensitive to the environmental conditions, including substrate type and low temperatures. However, little work is available on the effect of high temperature stresses on rate of radula development. This study is a first-order attempt in examining the relationship of radula production and temperature between two gastropod species with very different uses for their radula\u201a\u00c4\u00eea predator, Nucella lamellosa, and a grazer, Lottia pelta\u201a\u00c4\u00eeunder elevated temperature conditions. Row density of new radula growth, and relative tooth wear along the anterior end of the radula, were compared between species and across 3 temperature settings. A negative correlation between water temperature and row density was observed for both study species. Furthermore, elevated temperature was negatively correlated with both feeding rates and tooth wear in N. lamellosa. This study suggests that stress from elevated temperatures is detrimental to radula development between species, and that temperature stress leads to a reduction in feeding, and thus, reduced usage of the radula.","4102":"Scallops are marine bivalves that have a unique ability to swim and visualize their environment. Their eyes allow them to detect light and moving particles. It also gives them the ability to sense their surroundings and look for more suitable locations. In addition, the animals change their orientation position with water flow in order to maximize their food intake and growth. Both Chlamys rubida and Chlamys hastata exhibit these abilities, despite their morphological and behavioral differences. However, because of their profound distinctions that separate them between species, we suspect that the two groups will exhibit differences in their orientation preference to the current. Orientation position will optimize growth and feeding for these species within their local environment. Our hypothesis on scallops\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 orientation was tested in a flume tank. Their angle in respect to the water flow were measured and recorded for comparison. The experiment demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in orientation preference between the two species in a well-lit environment, and that their vision had no considerable influence on their orientation. However, we were able to find a statistical difference in how the two species preferred to orient themselves within a dark environment.","4103":"Global ocean acidification may be causing an increase in abundance of medusoid hydrozoans. Many medusoid hydrozoans are predators of epipelagic crustaceans and ecological competitors of fish for epipelagic prey. A change in this predator-prey dynamic may affect the entire epipelagic ecosystem. Ocean acidification exerts a physiological stress on planktonic crustaceans, which possess calcareous exoskeleton. It is therefore hypothesized that ocean acidification increases the feeding rate of medusoid hydrozoan on crustacean prey. This project aims to investigate the relationship between feeding rates of hydromedusa Aequorea Victoria on crustacean prey Artemia sp., under variable seawater CO2 concentrations: 450ppm CO2 and 950ppm CO2 . Each individual of A. Victoria was given 50 individual Artemia sp. and let feed for 1h under ambient temperature. Clearance rate was then calculated from the raw count of prey remaining after 1h. There is no statistically significant difference between the clearance rates of A. Victoria among the two treatment conditions and ambient seawater (n=5~9, p&gt;0.05). However, median of clearance rate under 950ppm CO2 treatment condition was higher than that under 450ppm CO2 treatment condition, suggesting a possible general trend.","4104":"Meiofauna are a diverse grouping of animals less than 2mm in size that live on and between sediment grains in all oceans at all depths. Though many studies have centered on the identification and description of species within particular meiofauna assemblages, few have focused on community structure or biodiversity within this interstitial ecosystem. San Juan Island, Washington, is surrounded by nutrient-rich waters that support high seasonal productivity. Novel species have been described from meiofaunal communities on and around San Juan Island, but whole meiofaunal community structures have not previously been examined in detail. This study compares the meiofaunal communities of three distinct areas on Eagle Cove beach, each of which is exposed to different physical conditions, particularly in the form of exposure to varying intensities of wave action. There are notable differences in community structure, though nematodes make up the majority of the meiofaunal population. This study provides morphospecies classifications and abundances, as well as measures biodiversity (species richness and evenness) using the Shannon-Wiener Index. Though each sample site has differing proportions of taxa, the differences in Shannon-Wiener values were not statistically significant.","4105":"The evolution of multicellular animals required the development of epithelial tissues that function in controlling the transport of molecules from one environment to another. Collagen proteins are crucial to the formation of epithelial tissues, and are therefore critical in understanding the origins of multicellularity and Metazoa. We looked for collagen type IV proteins in the recently sequenced Ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei genome, to assess whether this most basal of Metazoa phylum could contain conserved collagen proteins. We used Homo sapiens collagen type IV sequences and Blasted against the Moroz lab P.bachei genome server to search for collagen type IV proteins. We found that P. bachei possesses 6 distinct type IV alpha chains along three scaffolds, two of which were aligned in a head-to-head fashion, indicating both traditional and inverted gene duplication events. Given recent evidence suggesting that Ctenophores are possibly the most basal of the Metazoans, our findings suggest that the common ancestor to all Metazoa contained a much more developed collagen profile than previously appreciated.","4106":"There has been a long debate in the scientific community over the oldest surviving metazoan lineage. Traditionally it has been taught that Porifera, the sponges, occupy that nitche possessing a diploblastic body plan without true organs; however recent phylogentic analysis has suggests that Ctenophora may truly be the oldest lineage, free floating animals with a possible mesoderm layer and complex organs. In this study we searched for the presence of mesoderm in Ctenophora by examining the genome of Pleurobrachia bachei for the presence of tropomyosin, calponin, and \u0152\u2264-catenin. Gene expression for all three were found not only in the muscular regions of P. bachei, but in the epidermal tissues as well, indicating there is an unknown function in the metazoan common ancestor. Homology comparisons to the rest of Metazoa reveal little about tropomyosin and calponin, however the ctenophore \u0152\u2264-catenin protein appears to be to least derived of all metazoans and suggests Ctenophora may be the most basal extant metazoan lineage.","4107":"The evolution of the nervous system is poorly understood, with broad implications in basic neuroscience and regenerative medicine. The unintuitive nervous system of the basal Ctenophores provides an insight into neuronal evolution. We developed a Zero-Click computational pipeline for secretory peptide prediction from raw genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic sources (Girardo, 2012), in search of novel signaling pathways. This pipeline was applied to gene models produced from our Pleurobrachia bachei genome, initiated in July 2009 (Moroz, 2012), to obtain a list of 38 putative secretory peptides (Citarella, 2012). 10 of these peptides with no direct homology were selected for cloning and in situ hybridization. Many predicted products localize to neuronal structures, indicating a more complex neuropeptide signaling network than previously described in Ctenophore.","4108":"Brachyury is a transcription factor important for mesoderm formation in chordates. Ctenophores are basal metazoans with little known about their germ layer organization. For this reason, brachyury was used as a possible mesodermal marker in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei . The gene was cloned and then used for in situ hybridizations in adults. This revealed distinctive expression patterns in the tentacles and combs of the animal, with banding patterns indicative of possible muscle cells. The Pb brachyury sequence was also used to help validate extant gene models. It was found that these models did not correctly predict the brachyury gene structure. For this reason, the gene models were updated with new training data. The results of this were still pending at the time this paper was completed (June 1, 2012). Further research also needs to be done on brachyury expression in Pleurobrachia bachei embryos to completely understand its role in ctenophore development.","4109":"LIM homeobox (Lhx) gene family consists of six subfamilies of patterning genes which play a major role in the development of the nervous system and are found only in animals. We looked at their presence and expression in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei to study their evolution and development. Ctenophores are among the most basal metazoans and one of the first animals to have a nervous system. We found four Lhx genes in P. bachei, Lhx1\/5, Lhx3\/4, Islet and Lmx, with our gene prediction models. Lhx2\/9 and Lhx6\/8, the other two subfamilies in most metazoans, were absent. None of these genes would clone using an adult cDNA library but Lhx3\/4 and Lmx were successfully cloned using an embryonic cDNA library. Ctenophores and sponges are the only taxons that have four Lhx gene families instead of six. According to this genomic data, ctenophores and sponges are the most basally branched metazoans. Further research will be needed to understand the role that the Lhx gene family plays in the evolution and development of nerves in ctenophores.","4110":"Ctnenophores are a group of marine, jelly like, comb bearing metazoans. This phylum consists of an estimated 100-\u00ac\u221e\u00ac\u00a9\u201a\u00c4\u00ea200 species (Mills CE, 2012). Ctenophores are similar to cnidarians in that they have a homologous mesoderm consisting of a jelly like substance called mesoglea. They differ in that they do not have venomous stinging nematocysts but instead have numerous sticky colloblasts lining the tentacles. They also differ in locomotion, cnidarians typically use a contracting pulse of the bell to propel themselves, whereas, ctenophores use 8 rows of ctene plates that paddle the animal through the water. It is believed that they have true striated muscle and a primitive central nervous system (CNS) consisting of the aboral organ and polar fields. The Aboral organ is composed of a balancing statocyst that is attached to all ctene rows by a series of balancers and ciliated furrows. Signaling occurs from the aboral organ to the ctene rows. Each row is capable of beating separately from any of the others, indicating a complex signaling. Extending from this CNS are two nerve nets. One nerve net is located in the ectoderm while the other extends through the mesodermal mesoglea. Genetic data and morphology are both used in comparing basal metazoans and determining evolutionary ancestors.","4111":"Suspended-sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the Elwha River and nearshore environment off the river mouth were observed in order to determine the effects of the Elwha dam removal project on sediment supply to the river and marine environment. River gauge data over a 4-month period of dam removal from November 2011 to March 2012 was analyzed to identify deconstruction-caused SSC increases. Nearshore SSC was measured over the same period and was compared to oceanic and river data to determine controls on nearshore SSC levels. The 2011-2012 data was compared to data from a 2008 study to see what effects dam removal has had on SSC levels. The river had a background SSC level of about 100 mg L-1 with a maximum observed concentration of 2610 mg L-1. Nearshore SSC had a background level of 0-20 mg L-1 during the study with periodic events reaching levels of 50 mg L-1 and a maximum of 121 mg L-1 on March 30. The highest recorded river SSC levels corresponded with major deconstruction events, while the highest recorded nearshore SSC levels corresponded with strong sediment input from the river. Comparison with the 2008 data was made difficult by the large difference in river discharge between the two study periods. Dam removal resulted in pulses of sediment to the river that were measurable off the mouth of the river, indicating that deconstruction had a direct on effect on SSCs in both the river and nearshore environment.","4112":"For almost a century, the Elwha River has been constrained by the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, which have severely restricted the transport of fine sediment downriver. The dams are currently undergoing removal; it is the largest such project ever attempted in the United States. The purposes of this experiment were to identify the macrobenthos currently living on the subaqueous delta and determine the potential impacts of dam removal, and the ensuing sediment influx, on macrobenthic diversity. Samples of benthic organisms and sediment were collected from the delta floor, inventoried and analyzed, and the results mapped to find correlations between the two. The results showed patterns suggesting a correlation between grain size and diversity, with the greatest diversity at sites with high percentages of gravel, and the lowest diversity at sites with high percentages of mud. These findings demonstrate the importance of sediment size and sorting on the diversity of the Elwha delta. Given that the sediment in Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills is expected to continue traveling downstream, this information can be used to predict how the dam removal will impact macrobenthic communities on the delta, including economically important species such as clams, geoducks and crabs.","4113":"Grain-size distribution, one of important parameters reflecting sediment sources, transportation, and deposition, helps people understand and predict shoreline and bathymetric changes. For this study, wave-orbital velocity and tidal bed shear stress were compared to grain-size distribution of the Elwha River delta in order to find correlations between physical processes and the seabed composition. Grain-size distributions of sediments from the river, the bluff, and the delta were also examined to determine sources of sediments from the delta. The sand-dominant region found at the west side of the river mouth and some local landward coarsening patterns suggested that grain-size distribution was under influences of waves. Though no strong correlation was found between tidal bed shear stress and grain-size distribution, other evidence was provided that suggest the impacts of tidal-induced currents on grain-size distribution. We found the poorly sorted region at the western offshore of the river mouth and the coarse-grains dominant regions near the river mouth; it is possibly due to focused and strong currents that causes high bed shear stress in those regions. Moreover, tidal-induced currents have a net northeastward flow which brings fine sediments toward the east. Therefore, we observed a region of fine sediments at the east of the river mouth. Last, our results suggested that the bluff in Freshwater Bay supplies the delta with coarse sediments and the river mainly provides fine sediments.","4114":"The removal of the two dams on the Elwha River provides a large-scale backdrop for sediment transport research. The demolition will stimulate sediment-laden flows downstream, directly impacting the Elwha delta and the marine environment. This study uses two different tracers to track sediment movement along the Elwha River and in the Strait of Juan de Fuca: beryllium-7 (7Be) and grain texture and mineralogy. The objective of this study is to draw conclusions about the source of sediment reaching the mouth of the river. Using these tracing methods, we found that (1) 7Be functions as a useful tool when researching sediment transport during dam removals, (2) the grains examined at the mouth of the Elwha River are a mixture of both sediment from upriver and from the glacially deposited bluffs along the shoreline, and (3) there is evidence of sediment from the former reservoirs making its way to the delta. The source of sediment reaching the delta is most likely a mixture of normal depositional processes due to fluctuating river discharge and reworking of the river bed sediments due to dam removal as the former reservoirs, Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell, erode into their pre-dammed form.","4115":"The objective of this research was to characterize nutrient concentrations and distributions throughout the Elwha River watershed, focusing on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phosphorus and silicic acid. Previous research has indicated that the Elwha River is oligotrophic, however with the removal of the dams comes the subsequent discharge of a large fraction of the 1.9x106 m3 of sediment trapped behind the dams. Understanding the nutrient composition and distribution relative to grain size and suspended sediments will provide scientists with perspective as to how the ecosystem is going to react to dam removal. Sediments and their pore water were collected in the field and analyzed. Additional data was included from U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Ecology. The culmination of this data demonstrates that the upper stretches of the Elwha River are nutrient poor but the recent removal of the two dams has led to an increase of nutrients within the nearshore environment, which is hypothesized to be related to the discharge of sediment based on this research. Implications for future studies can be made that refer to primary productivity, riparian health and the return of salmon.","4116":"The delivery and deposition of particulate organic carbon (POC) into the marine environment via rivers impacts local biological and geological processes as well as the global carbon cycle. This is especially the case in small mountainous rivers, such as the Elwha River, Washington, which delivers a significant fraction of particulate organic carbon to the Strait of Juan de Fuca annually. Recently, the Elwha has begun undergoing dam deconstruction. To study the resulting fluctuations of POC in response to dam removal, water and seabed samples were collected and analyzed using loss on ignition to estimate levels of POC. The concentrations of suspended sediments in the water column and compositions of grain size in the marine seabed sediments were also examined. Seabed samples were found to contain higher concentrations of POC compared to surface water samples. POC levels increased when more suspended material was present in the river, and also when seabed samples consisted primarily of mud. Overall, the major concentrations of POC occurred below the Glines Canyon and Elwha Dams, where sediment is being released and eroded due to dam removal processes, and also in the river mouth, which is an area of high turbidity.","4117":"Using digital photographs, this study investigates sediment movement eastwards by the dominant northwest swell in Freshwater Bay, WA. Twenty samples were taken at five locations and analyzed with the Cobble cam analysis package. It was found that sand and smaller pebbles were more prevalent on the western updrift shore than on the delta face and that no silt and clay were found on the foreshore. Sand was not evident on the most eastern site and mean sediment grain size increased eastward. Wave rays hit the western face of the delta orthogonal to the shore and result in more pronounced cusps in the eastern direction. The westerly portion experiences oblique waves and results in longshore transport eastward in Freshwater Bay. Pacific Ocean swell from the west had the most impact while local wind-generated waves from the northeast and northwest had the least. Pebbles were selectively moved by the wave regime for each section of beach. All the sediment along the western delta was removed and indicates that longshore transport is sediment starved.","4118":"The mysid Archaeomysis grebnitzkii is a small detrivorous crustacean that is prey to many low level consumers. In vitro, we fed A. grebnitzkii fresh and aged blended Nereocystis luetkeana as well as a blend of phytoplankton and measured preference and differential growth between these diets. We were unable to detect feeding preference or changes in length or weight, however the fresh kelp treatment had a much higher mortality rate than the other treatments, a result we were able to reproduce in a second trial.","4119":"Our study seeks to gain more information on the migration and feeding patterns of two common intertidal carnivorous snails, Nucella lamellosa and Nucella ostrina. These whelks are native to the western coast of the United States ranging from California to Alaska and feed primarily on barnacles. The information from our study will be useful in determining some of the effects of global climate change on the intertidal ecosystem. Because of the predatory feeding pattern of these animals they are important in determining what else can live in the region. We gained more clarity on the patterns exhibited by these snails during the period between feeding peaks by observing the counts and densities within a plot on the shoreline as well as the movement of tagged individuals. We found that although there was no feeding peak during our study, and therefore no mass vertical migration, the N. lamellosa did appear to be feeding in a higher percentage higher up the shore. We also gained some insight into the effects of radio tagging on snail behavior when we discovered that that radio tagged N. lamellosa appeared lower on the shore than those without radio tags. This information will help further studies on whelks.","4120":"Phytoplankters are primary producers and an important energy source within pelagic nearshore habitats. The growth of these organisms is affected by riverine-oceanic interactions. A measurable interaction over 24 hours is the density difference between these water sources, where less-dense riverine water is warmer and has lower salinity. Ebb currents enhance the advection of riverine output, placing it on top of the oceanic water and creating stratification. Primary production increased during stratification periods, but reduced when transitioning between a flood and ebb current. Visual analysis of phytoplankton community composition also highlighted increases in the population during high ebb and flood current rates. The large increase in Skeletonema population during this study suggested that the movement or growth of certain phytoplankton genera are affected by these water source interactions. This study concludes that since changes happen within the water column over a short period of time, an entire tidal exchange must be monitored before any conclusions can be made about the water column or its occupants.","4121":"Nucella ostrina and Nucella lamellosa are two species of predatory marine intertidal snail. They are common along the coast from California to Alaska, US and prey upon barnacles. We studied vertical migration and feeding patterns of each species and the best method for tagging them. We found that there was not much fluctuation in vertical movement, nor any significant peaks in feeding over our study period; however we did verify that N. lamellosa move up the shore a bit to feed. We also found that radio tagged N. lamellosa were more abundant lower on shore than their typical zone. These studies will help future studies on Nucella spp as well as further advance our efforts in predicting effects of climate change of behavior.","4122":"Drift algal material exported from kelp beds plays a significant role in nearby ecosystems. Phenotypic traits such as gonad index and jaw diameter can be indicators of diet consistency and nutrient uptake and thus can be used to assess the possible role of exported kelp. In this study, individuals of an herbivorous (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) and a filter feeding (Balanus nubilus) species were sampled from near the kelp beds in the shallow subtidal photic environment (SSPE) and far from the kelp beds in the deep subtidal environment (DSE). Urchins in the DSE had significantly larger gonads and jaws in comparison to individuals in the SSPE. I conclude that urchins in the DSE were getting better fed, whether through quantity or quality of food, suggesting that drift algae was being exported from nearby kelp beds. There was no significant difference between barnacle gonad indices with depth suggesting that their particulate organic matter food was equal at both depths. Future studies could examine gut contents to determine if there are diet differences between the two depths.","4123":"Spatial subsidies including particulate organic matter (POM) play an important role in near-shore food web ecology. Fatty acid (FA) analysis has proven an effective tool for constructing these food webs, although the FA profiles of many marine autotrophs and the validity of culturing is still unknown. We cultured the diatom Skeletonema cf. marinoi using dialysis tubes and compared the FA profile to published batch culture FA profiles and to POM FA profiles. PERMANOVA analysis showed that FA profiles of dialysis replicates were not significantly different from each other (p=0.14) but were different from batch culture (p=0.001) and POM data (p=0.0001). FA suites from cultured phytoplankton may delineate specific phytoplankton taxa, but further studies are necessary to determine the most accurate culturing method.","4124":"The mysid Archaeomysis grebnitzkii is an important detritovore and prey in many food webs. In this experiment A. grebnitzkii was feed phytoplankton, blended fresh kelp, and blended aged kelp for 15 days while growth and diet preference were measured. Growth was measured as a molt rate and condition index. The preference was measured by the absorbance of chlorophyll a in solution. Unfortunately, growth was not observed in any of the treatments and chlorophyll a did not provide any indication of preference for a specific diet. Of all the treatments fresh kelp had the least molts and the lowest condition index. A strong negative response to fresh kelp particles was recorded.","4125":"The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effect of water flow on fertilization success of Nereocystis gametophytes and growth rates of young sporophytes. My null hypothesis was that there would be no differences between the flows. However, I found that in my experimental setup, benthic diatoms outcompeted the Nereocystis sporophytes and grew over them. I thus analyzed differences in diatom growth under different water flow treatments, and found that there was a clear trend of more diatom chlorophyll and organic biomass in high flow conditions.","4126":"Global warming is a worldwide phenomenon that is the result of anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Although the increase in carbon dioxide levels now is 100 times faster than at the end of the last ice age (IPCC 2001, 2007), the ocean is the most important sink of carbon dioxide and have absorbed approximately half of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (Sabine et al. 2004). Many consequences are expected of global warming are occurring presently, one of which is ocean acidification. The average ocean surface water pH has decreased from 8.21 to 8.10 recently (Royal Society 2005). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts CO2 concentrations to reach 800ppmv by the end of the century which is equivalent to a decrease of 0.3-0.4 pH units (Orr et al. 2005). An effect of acidifying seawater is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, a drastic change in environmental condition for shell-forming marine organisms (Doney et al. 2009). The organisms affected directly ranges from plankton to corals, molluscs, and sea urchins (Doney et al. 2009). For example, reduced shell and soft body growth have been reported in mussels (Gazeau et al. 2007) and metabolic depression has been seen in European eels (Anguila anguila) at CO2 levels above 2% (Cruz-Neto and Steffensen 1997). Bacteria are hugely important to all ecosystems, including marine habitats. Marine bacteria are uniquely adapted to saline environments and they need salt for growth (Fenical 1993). Most marine bacteria are unicellular (Fenical 1993) and some such as Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are abundant oceanic primary producers (Azam and Worden 2004). Although the distribution of marine bacteria is poorly studied, 90% of marine bacterial flora is of the gram-negative genus Vibrio (Fenical 1993). Wang 3 Sediments, animate and inanimate surfaces, and internal spaces of living organisms are important microhabitats of marine bacteria (Fenical 1993). Internal spaces of marine organisms are often more nutrient rich than seawater (Fenical 1993). In particular, sponges and bacteria can form symbioses (Lee et al. 2009). Sponges can acquire their bacterial partners by filter feeding and selectively retaining bacteria (Taylor et al. 2007). The relationship is often mutualistic; bacteria benefit nutritionally while bacteria help sponges eliminate waste more efficiently (Beer and Ilan 1998), stabilize the skeleton (Rutzler 1985), or defend against pathogens and predators (Bewley et al. 1996). Bacteria are observed on the surface of Oriental shrimp (Palaeomon macrodactylus) eggs, American lobster (Homarus americanus) eggs, coral reefs, sea jellies, and other bacteria such as cyanobacterium Microcoleus lyngbyaceus (Fenical 1993). Bacteria are notably associated with chitinous plankton (Vezzulli et al. 2012). They are also a major food source for invertebrates, which reflects the energy available for higher trophic levels (Hall and Meyer 1998). Hall and Meyer (1998) found that invertebrates could derive &lt;10% to 100% of their carbon requirements from bacteria. Marine microorganisms such as bacteria have the potential for rapid growth. Thus, marine microorganisms are critical to global nutrient cycles (Arrigo 2005). Nitrogen, an essential nutrient, is used by organisms to form proteins, chlorophyll, and nucleic acids (Murray et al. 2005). In the ocean, it is present as a dissolved gas or as dissolved inorganic ions: nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium (Murray et al. 2005). Once thought to be restricted to very specific habitats and microbes, now we know that many bacteria are known for their nitrification and denitrification services to the ecosystem (Zehr and Ward 2002). Nitrification is a process of oxidation from ammonia to nitrate with nitrite as an intermediate species (Figure 3). Denitrification is the reverse reaction where nitrate is reduced to nitrite and is converted to nitrogen gas (Figure 3). Bacteria mediate these two processes which makes nutrients available to many organisms, including phytoplankton. Biodiversity of plant and animal communities are dependent on the availability of these nutrients (Bienhold et al. 2012). The objective of this mesocosm experiment is to determine differences in bacteria abundance in normal (600\u0152\u00baatm), medium (1000\u0152\u00baatm), and high (1300\u0152\u00baatm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms serve as an intermediate for lab and field studies; mesocosms provide insight about changes to food webs, communities, and ecosystems.","4127":"Morphological and molecular (ITS and TufA nuclear DNA) analysis was carried out on some endolithic green algal strains to examine their relationship and boring activity. Using the BLAST, the closest relative to most of the studied strains was the Acrochaete (= Ulvella) sp. Phylogentic tree, maximum likelihood was used to compare study strains and some unpublished sequences obtained from O\u201a\u00c4\u00f4Kelly Laboratory. It was observed from the maximum likelihood tree, that F442 and F446 strains have same evolutionary relationship which was supported by their similar morphological descriptions. The resulting clade of five (F190, F601, F646, F442\/F446, F388\/F408) sequences was distant from all other Ulvella sequences, suggesting a previously-unrecognized species group within Ulvella. Boring activity was not determined as the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) broke down during the study. Further research using several primers and phylogenetic trees analysis to confirm the appropriate identity of strains is recommended.","4128":"This project is an initial effort to determine the effects of increasing temperatures on photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) relationships, respiration and the daily metabolic carbon balance of Nereocystis luetkeana at Friday Harbor Laboratories, in San Juan Island, USA. P-I Curves were performed at 11\u00ac\u221eC and 16\u00ac\u221eC. Nereocystis luetkeana in the San Juan Islands seems to be favored by higher temperatures as lower respiration rates, lower Ic, higher photosynthetic rates and significantly higher DMCB were recorded for 16\u00ac\u221eC compared to 11\u00ac\u221eC. However these results are preliminary and only analyze one factor of change: temperature. There are other abiotic stressors changing due to climate change which could have other effects on Nereocystis luetkeana ecophysiology. It is also important to consider that climate change can directly affect not only physiological stress but also indirectly via changing relationships among species. Thus, to better understand ecological change we should understand the ways in which biotic and abiotic factors interact to determine the distribution and abundance of species in space and time.","4129":"False Bay in San Juan Island, WA (N48.4865\u00ac\u221e, W123.0680\u00ac\u221e) is a biological preserve on the southwest side of San Juan Island. The watershed includes Trout Lake, the main supply of water for the town of Friday Harbor. Ulvoid blooms have been common which produces a stench as well as possibility for research into the cause. Sampling of the biomass, nitrate concentrations, oxygen saturation, salinity, and temperature at both high tide of August 14, 2012 and low tide on August 15, 2012 revealed small impact of creek or possible agricultural runoff than previously expected. Small amounts of nitrate did not appear to correlate with biomass readings and differences in oxygen saturation. It suggested possible uptake of ulvoids instead. This study provides a jumping off point for future research into causes of ulvoid blooms and nutrient cycling in the bay as well as the unique ecology of this system.","4130":"The growth of the warm-water, Mexican strain of the giant-celled marine red alga Griffithsia pacifica Kylin has been studied in great detail. However, a comparison of the growth rates of this strain to the local strains located in Friday Harbor, Washington has not been conducted. This study compared the short-term growth rates of the two strains of Griffithsia under varying light intensities. Stock cultures from the Botany Department at the University of Washington, Seattle and wild samples collected from the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories in Friday Harbor, Washington were examined. Wild samples were collected from coordinates at N 48\u00ac\u221e 32.723\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 W 123\u00ac\u221e 00.729\u201a\u00c4\u00f4. Prior to cell excision, wild samples were cleaned using sterile razor blades and agar to remove epiphytes and contaminants. All cells were excised and grown in f\/2 media for 6 days under LED lights at three intensities: 25, 16 and 8 \u0152\u00bamol\/m2\/s. Morphological difference between stock and wild cultures were observed. Half the stock culture subjects and one third the wild culture subjects died. However, others experienced growth, with the lowest light intensity cultures having a higher growth rate than the higher intensities. The low light stock (8 \u0152\u00bamol\/m2\/s) cultures had significantly higher growth rates than both the low light wild and ambient light (25 \u0152\u00bamol\/m2\/s) stock. The increased growth rate is likely a result of the stock cultures being acclimated to irradiances between 5-10 \u0152\u00bamol\/m2\/s. Future studies of longer time periods and with varying light intensities and temperatures are proposed to further investigate perceived differences.","4131":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are commonly produced by cells to defend against invading pathogens. As such, ROS are an important feature of wound responses in organisms as distantly related as algae, vascular plants, and animals. However, despite the fact that most pathogen-elicited oxidative burst are of enzymatic origin, the origin of wound-induced ROS is unknown. In this study, I identified a wound-induced oxidative burst in the kelp Saccharina latissima, and this oxidative burst was investigated at different light levels. Both sham wounding and wounding led to ROS production that varied with light level, although the relationship between the magnitude of the oxidative burst and irradiance was not linear. Since the wound-induced burst of S. latissima is affected by light level, it probably has its origins in accidental ROS formation due to the breakdown of the photosynthetic electron transport chain.","4132":"The kelp crab of the northeastern Pacific coast, Pugettia producta, has long been believed to be a facultative herbivore, feeding on macroalgae in the warmer months and on small invertebrates when algae are unavailable. Many claims have been made as to which algae are preferred, information important to determining the ecological role of this small brachyuran, most recently and convincingly Nereocystis luetkeana. Here, two non-kelp species are evaluated alongside two kelp species in a standard feeding preference assay. Results indicate that P. producta may prefer Ulva spp. over kelp species, the algal type to which it is most often ascribed a preference.","4133":"Allelopathy in plants is a known phenomenon that describe chemical defense against other plants. Lately there are studies that describe this phenomenon in the marine environment but most of the study don't concentrate on the macroalgae-macroalgae relationship. In this study I tried to learn how different native algae influence on the Sargassum muticum's growth. I found out that under stress the Sargassum's growth can be inhibited by the Ulva californica and Fucus distichus , but not by Pyropia kanakaensis. I also tried to determine whether the snail Lacuna vincta eats the Sargassum itself or just the diatoms on the surface. My very preliminary results show that the Lacuna prefer to eat the diatoms.","4134":"I use three simple models to assess the degree to which thickness of the upper element of a coccolith and the height of the connecting stalk influence a coccolithophore\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sinking rate, and ability to acquire light. One generates different coccolith profiles by varying how the same amount of mass is distributed among three stacked cylinders, representative of a coccolith. Another examines the sinking velocity of the coccolithophore as a function of the height of the stalk. Stalk height has a significant effect on the sinking velocity, as it can extend the radius of the coccolithophore and increase drag. The third model, looks at how transmission of light through a coccolith affects the irradiance at the cell surface. The thickness of the top element of the coccolith has a small effect on the transmission of light to the cell surface. Calcite is pretty translucent, especially when considering the thickness of the structure is ~50 nanometers thick. These models are then cross tested to see what is the effect of upper coccolith element thickness on sinking rate and what is the effect of stalk height on transmission. Physics-based models are a good first step in exploring the relative importance of different morphological features.","4135":"Mass transfer in corals is dependent on sufficient flow over individual polyps, and thus is influenced by both gross coral morphology and local surface texture. This study uses plaster dissolution models and flow analysis to examine the effects of verrucose, pocked, and furrowed surface morphologies on potential mass transfer across plate corals. It also examines how flow interacts with these surfaces across platelike and cylindrical objects. Generally, dissolution per unit profile area increased with added ornamentation and surface area. However, there were diminishing returns with regards to material investment; the more surface area there was for dissolution, the less efficient dissolution was per unit surface area. Secondly, surface texture dictated flow of water, either directing flow to or away from the colony, or quelling movement completely. Surface texture also directs flow differently depending on gross morphology. Understanding flow at small scales, particularly around locations of polyps, is important for understanding mass transfer. This study is a first order attempt to address this issue, but further work is needed to quantify flow at the locations of polyps and the role of particular surface textures in engineering local flow regimes.","4136":"Arthropods are well known for being extraordinarily diverse. Variation of form and niche-occupation in arthropods relies on specialized appendages and regionalization of a common bauplan. In the marine realm, ancient trilobites exhibit extreme exoskeleton disparity. It is commonly accepted that much of the variety of trilobite evolution, particularly in the head, reflects adaptation to assorted environments. Here, I demonstrate the relationship between cephalon morphology and fluid flow through turbulence and drag force. I examine the effect of genal spine length on (1) degree and position of turbulence relative to the trilobite body along with (2) amount of drag felt on the organism. General morphology of Devonian Eldredgeops (Trilobita: Phacopida) was used as a template. I do not suggest that Eldredgeops may have possessed cephalic spines, but rather, models were constructed with varying lengths of genal spines as a proof of concept. Trilobite models were constructed with five different genal spine lengths, from absent genal spines to spines extending past the rear of the body. In a flow tank, the forms were analyzed with dye stream tests to identify minimum turbulence and with a force transducer to measure drag forces. Laser techniques were used to visualize flow. Results address biomechanics of trilobite cephalon morphology as they affect the fluid dynamics around the entire body. I discuss ecological implications of these findings.","4137":"Seabird abundance in the San Juan Channel is affected by variations in tidal current speed and direction. In this paper we investigate the abundance and community structure of seabirds in a tidally active transect of San Juan Channel. Using a variation of the strip-transect vessel survey method, we observed the abundance of birds in a 200 m wide strip between Turn Rock and Shaw Island. We divided tidal current into five different categories, and conducted 36 transects, recording the number of birds observed during each tidal current category. Our results suggest that the presence of birds in San Juan Channel correlates with changes in tidal current speed and direction. We observed a greater number of birds during periods of fast current, and fewer birds during slack and slow ebbs. When focusing our analysis on gulls and alcids, we discovered that while alcids prefer fast floods, gulls prefer fast ebbs. Finally, we observed that Rhinoceros Auklets and Common Murres have similar tidal current speed and direction preference. These surveys demonstrate the importance of the variation in current speed and direction on marine bird behavior in the San Juan Channel.","4138":"In recent years, the oyster Crassostrea gigas has been subject to recurrent outbreaks of vibriosis. The bacteria Vibrio tubiashii induces acute mortality in the veliger larval stage, with severe repercussions for aquaculture and recruitment. The disease is known to be correlated with environmental factors such as temperature and salinity. In our study, we sought to examine the relationship between a rapidly changing environmental factor, ocean acidification, and pathogenicity using a series of larval inoculations at two different carbon dioxide concentration, bacterial strains, larval ages, and bacterial dilutions. Our results of mortality and LD50 indicate that some strains of V. tubiashii may be less pathogenic under acidified conditions and these findings warrant more investigation.","4139":"Despite the name, carbonate-boring algae are in fact quite interesting. Contributing equivalent to 20% of CO2 to the biosphere as human activities through their CaCO3 dissolution, these algae have broad ecological impacts. Morphological analysis of five genera of carbonate-boring algae found at Argyle Lagoon, San Juan Island, WA, as well as analysis of 3-dimensional resin casts of the bore holes, showed that using morphology to study diversity tells an incomplete story. Phylogenetic analysis of laboratory algal cultures of cool-temperate carbonate borers revealed a strong genetic difference between subtidal and intertidal species studied, indicating that these algae possess at least some degree of tidal height zonation.","4140":"Salinity fluctuations are expected to become increasingly frequent in the Salish Sea due to glacial melting caused by global warming. Pisaster ochraceus, a keystone predator of the intertidal zone will be especially affected by these fluctuations since they lack the ability to ion- or osmo-regulate. We examined the impact of prior exposure to low salinity and the presence of a food patch on the behavior of P. ochraceus larvae in a halocline. In the gastrula stage, P. ochraceus larvae were split into a low salinity treatment (reared in 20-22\u201a\u00c4\u221e filtered sea water) and a control treatment (reared in 30- 32\u201a\u00c4\u221e filtered sea water). In the first experiment, bipinnariae were introduced into the top or bottom of 20\/30 haloclines. In the second experiment brachiolariae were introduced into control columns with and without the algae Isochrysis galbana, and into 20\/30 haloclines with and without I. galbana patches at the halocline. The halocline posed a major barrier to larval vertical migration, especially for the younger bipinnaria stage. Low salinity larvae changed their distribution in the water column at a much slower rate than control larvae, indicating that they may have impaired swimming abilities. Brachiolariae from the controls aggregated in the halocline when a food patch was present but those from low salinity swam right through the food patch to the top of the column. Lowered salinity in the Salish Sea could result in larvae arriving in unsuitable habitats since their different vertical distribution in the water column may result in currents carrying them to unsuitable habitats. Smaller adult P. ochraceus populations in the rocky intertidal could result in drastic changes to the ecosystem including a reduction in species diversity.","4141":"Production of biofuels derived from the mass of photosynthetic organisms is gaining attractiveness as climate change, resource shortage, and pollution events make it less sensible to continue current modes of fossil fuel consumption. The high oil-toweight ratio of algae yields potential as a sustainable source of biodiesel, but current cultivation systems are plagued with contamination events leading to crop failure. Protozoic amoebae are the culprits of this invasion and while their feeding preferences or abilities are well known in regards to bacteria, with algae they are not. To begin implying an index of susceptibility between amoebic strains and marine algae, isolated Neoparamoeba sp., Paramoeba sp., and Thecamoeba sp. specimens from Hawai\u201a\u00c4\u00f4i were given treatments of marine algae (Chaetoceros sp., Pleurochrysis carterae, Nanochloropsis sp., Skeletonema marinoi, Isochrysis sp.) in f\/2- (silicon absent) media and algal density correlated to spectrophotometer absorbance values. Also, bacterial treatments were smeared in a uni-directional \u201a\u00c4\u00faraceway\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on f\/2- agar and the distance that amoebae from one end of the strip recorded as average migration rate per day. These methods proved successful in illustrating that the feeding abilities or preferences of marine amoebae vary greatly across algal and bacterial species. This valuable insight may inform managerial decisions in the event of contamination discovery and highlight directions for further research into the specific relationships between marine algae, bacteria, and amoebae that might either support or suppress the successful commercial cultivation of algae as a feedstock for biodiesel.","4142":"The evolution of multicellular animals required the development of epithelial tissues that function in controlling the transport of molecules from one environment to another. Collagen proteins are crucial to the formation of epithelial tissues, and are therefore critical in understanding the origins of multicellularity and Metazoa. We looked for collagen proteins in the recently sequenced Ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei genome, using collagen sequences from both Homo sapiens and basal organisms as templates. We discovered that P. bachei has 7 distinct type IV collagen sequences along three genomic scaffolds. Two of these were aligned in an in-line pattern along the genome, while another two were aligned in a head-to-head fashion, indicating both traditional and inverted gene duplication events. Furthermore, collagen IV intra-genic investigations showed that P. bachei has a more diverse set of \u0152\u00b1-chains than Homo sapiens. In addition, we found 4 conserved collagen domain proteins which we were unable to assign to specific collagen families. Given recent evidence suggesting that Ctenophores are the most basal phyla of the Metazoans, our findings suggest that the common ancestor to all Metazoa contained a much more developed collagen profile than previously appreciated.","4143":"Recent research on burrowing mechanics suggests that animals may be moving through crack propagation and that the material properties of a sediment may be important for the ability of animals to move it. Two species of Abarenicola who inhabit distinct areas of False Bay were examined. It was hypothesized that a sediment\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s stiffness would be related to its grain-size composition and to animal distributions, and that worms would burrow more successfully in their own sediment. In sites with either A. pacifica or A. claparedi, grain size distribution was analyzed and a modified penetration test was used to quantify the stiffness of sediments. Additionally, each species was timed burrowing in the field in either its own sediment or the sediment of the other species. A. pacifica lived in stiffer, poorly-sorted sediment with a high proportion of silts and clays, while A. claparedi were found in less stiff, well-sorted sediments consisting mostly of fine sands. Despite living in distinct sediment types, worms did not burrow more quickly in their own sediment. However, burrowing angle and speed changes throughout burrowing suggest A. claparedi struggled to burrow successfully in the stiffer sediment of A. pacifica. Our results suggest that the material properties of sediment do vary with the grain size composition and that these material properties may play an important role in determining animal success in an area. However, the affect of the material properties of sediment on burrowing of Abarenicola in the field is not as simple as originally hypothesized.","4144":"Thin phytoplankton layers are characterized by dense concentration of cells a few centimeters to several meters thick at haloclines. They extend horizontally for kilometers and can persist for days. These dense concentrations of phytoplankton have the potential to influence the behavior, feeding success, and predation by higher trophic levels. This study looked at changes in the vertical distribution and persistence of two algae Isochrysis galbana and Rhodomonas sp. at concentrations of 12,000-66,000 cells\/ml, at and below a halocline in the presence and absence of a predator Pisaster ochraceus larvae. Three treatments with two replicates per treatment were set up, columns with, a) algae at the halocline + larvae, b) algae at the halocline \u201a\u00c4\u00ec larvae, c) no algae + larvae in halocline. In each case, approximately 100 larvae were gravity fed to the bottom of each column. Patch width was measured 1, 3, and 6 hour after introduction into the columns. Patch width for Rhodomonas sp. remained near one cm for six hours while patch width for I. galbana increased to two cm in six hrs. For both algal species, cell concentration at the halocline declined significantly in the presence of Pisaster larvae. A greater decrease in cell concentration was observed for I. galbana when the food was at the bottom of the column rather than at the halocline. This was observed in the presence and absence of larvae. This indicates that for I. galbana, the decline in algal cell concentration at the bottom of the column might be due to cell movement towards the halocline. Interestingly, larvae remained around the halocline in the presence or absence of food for 6 hours. Living in stratified layers where thin phytoplankton layers might exist can be advantageous for P. ochraceus larvae by providing them with resources to feed, grow, and metamorphose but might also expose them to predation by higher trophic levels.","4145":"Phoronida (Lophophorata) is the perplexing, small group of marine invertebrates that contains at least 10 species of lophophore-bearing horseshoe worms. One species, Phoronis pallida, is an inquiline commensal that aggregates in burrows made by the mud shrimp Upogebia pugettensis. Similar to other species of phoronids, there are questions surrounding the biogeography and reproductive habits of Phoronis pallida. The purpose of this study is to examine the P. pallida population level structure in Puget Sound, Washington, USA, and also infer from these data if the adults of this species are capable of reproducing asexually. Adult P. pallida specimens were collected from the shrimp burrows in the low intertidal mud flats of False Bay, Argyle Lagoon, and Padilla Bay in Washington\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Puget Sound region. Twenty-seven samples of this phoronid were collected from 16 burrows among all sites and successfully analyzed using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit one gene (COI). Statistical parsimony identified 24 distinct haplotypes sorted into two networks. The networks showed no geographic pattern among our sites but were separated by a large p-distance of 0.06 indicating either a sequence divergence. No evidence for asexual reproduction was found since only genetically distinct individuals were found from the same burrows. Further sampling at larger spatial scales is necessary to find the total number of haplotypes, determine if the networks correlate to larger geographic areas, and investigate the sequence divergence in P. pallida.","4146":"The glucocorticoid stress response has recently been linked to characteristic, stable suites of behavior (\u201a\u00c4\u00fapersonality\u201a\u00c4\u00f9) that hold fixed through time and environmental context. To lay groundwork for future study of this personality-CORT association, the stress responses of wild-caught rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) were characterized by determining the corticosterone (CORT) concentration in cloacal fluid (CF) collected noninvasively over 60 min of restraint. On the basis of previous studies of sparrows and tits, we hypothesized that social dominance would be inversely correlated both with baseline CF CORT concentration and with the response of CF CORT to restraint. After capture, restrained birds were held in the hand and fed for 45 min, during which a separate CF sample was collected over each of three 15-min periods. For the final 15 min, birds were moved to a flight cage and a fourth CF sample was collected without handling the bird; all samples were analyzed by direct RIA. In contrast to our predictions, baseline CF CORT (first 15-min sample) of all three age-sex classes did not differ. Although the predicted relation between previously published dominance status in this species (adult females &gt; first-year males &gt; first-year females) and CORT levels was not supported, young males tended to develop higher CF CORT concentration in response to restraint than did females of any age. Of six behaviors measured in the flight cage, one was inversely correlated with CF CORT concentrations in response to restraint: birds with higher CF CORT were significantly more restricted spatially in their exploration of the flight cage. Additionally, adult and hatch-year females tended to perch more on the front and side of the cage than hatch-year males did. In contrast to a previous study of restraint stress in captive rufous hummingbirds, the wild-caught birds in our study showed significantly increased CF CORT within 30 min of capture and no significant change thereafter, suggesting that the stress response can be quantified in the field in a shorter period of time with this noninvasive method than was previously thought.","4147":"Environmental variations act as stressors on organisms, and can strongly influence the geographic ranges of species. A source of environmental variation in the marine environments of the San Juan Islands is salinity concentrations. Echinoderms, namely Pisaster ochraceus, are heavily impacted by these fluctuations, and past experiments have shown that they can directly influence larval morphology and distribution within a vertical water column. We investigated whether the differences in vertical distributions were due to salinity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s impacts on their hydrodynamic capabilities by tracking their instantaneous swimming patterns in a vertical water column and in a halocline. The analysis is still in progress, but the results could lend insight into the effects a less saline environment might have on an echinoderm\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s capabilities of distribution.","4148":"Brachyury and Forkhead are transcription factors that play an important role for development within organisms. Ctenophores are basal metazoans with little known about what kind of gene they have or where these genes are expressed. For these reasons, brachyury and forkhead are used as a markers in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei. These genes were cloned and then used for in situ hybridizations in adults. This revealed distinctive expression patterns for brachyruy in the esophagus and stomach, while forkhead was expressed in the tentacles and combs rows of the animal. Not to mention, that through genomics and bioinformatics the forkhead genome has been discovered. Revealing that there is 24 forkhead genes within the genome of ctenophores.","4149":"Modern ecological theory is largely based off mean field assumptions that can overlook the critically important \u201a\u00c4\u00fapatchiness\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, areas of high and low resource distributions, that define ecosystems. Also, studying the fine scale distributions of microorganisms in these patches has traditionally involved very expensive, resource intensive methods. This has greatly hindered the ability to conduct research in this area. This paper present an alternative, high tech, low cost method that can be used to study these patch dynamics across a range of scales, from that of 10\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s of centimeters to that of kilometers. This method involves the use of a waterproof enclosure that houses a microcomputer and imaging capture device that, with accompanying software, can analyze large batches of video for the presence, or lack thereof, of organisms of a desired size class. This paper also suggests a method, namely fractal analysis, which can be used to compare the self\u201a\u00c4\u00easimilarity, or lack thereof, of various organism distributions over a range of scales. Preliminary results seem to indicate a rough correlation between organisms of a small size and those of a larger size, though further data and analysis is necessary for confirmation. Further fine-tuning and utilization of this imagine system promises a high potential yet low cost way in which researchers in both terrestrial and marine landscapes can simultaneously analyze a greater volume of data while reducing their workload in terms of manual analysis.","4150":"The red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) is a common subtidal herbivore throughout the northeast Pacific. In the San Juan Archipelago (SJA), Washington, red urchins are subject to little predation pressure and are generally exposed and sedentary. Recent research has shown that detached drift algae are common and abundant at all subtidal depths surveyed (&gt;150 m) in the SJA. Here, we investigated whether red urchin feeding rates observed in the laboratory were consistent with field observations of drift capture. Feeding rates were quantified for captive red urchins; from most to least rapidly consumed (grams per hour), these were: Nereocystis luetkeana, Mazzaella splendens, Saccharina sp., Agarum fimbriatum, and Ulva sp. In the field using SCUBA, we repeatedly collected all algae captured by urchins at one-day and six-day intervals within a 25 m2 permanent transect at a depth of 18 m. We identified, blotted, and massed the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2stolen\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 algae to compare taxonomic composition and mass captured over different time frames, assuming that drift held after a longer time period would more closely reflect urchin preference. Results indicate that at least at this site, availability of particular algae is more important in determining overall drift capture rates than is urchin preference. However, captured Agarum constituted a smaller proportion of total algal mass when urchins were given six days to collect drift, indicating that they are likely discarding this alga. This result is consistent with current and previous lab preference studies and suggests that the large quantity of Agarum drift into deep water is a lowquality subsidy, at least for urchins.","4151":"Ocean acidification (OA), a result of increased atmospheric CO2, is predicted to decrease the surface ocean pH by a value of 0.4 units by the year 2100. Decreases in pH have been shown to cause deleterious effects on many calcifying marine organisms, which may negatively affect ecosystem functions. Few studies, however, have investigated OA impacts on fertilization success of free-spawning marine organisms. This study focuses on the effects of OA on fertilization success in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. The goal of this study is to experimentally determine whether decreases in pH values lower fertilization success in D. excentricus. The two-pH treatments chosen for this experiment reflect the present day pH value (8.1) and the predicted pH value by the IPPC for the year 2100 (7.7). Gametes from adult D. excentricus collected from Crescent Bay, East Sound, Orcas Island, WA, were fertilized in filtered seawater with pH 8.1 and 7.7. Fertilization success was determined by the percentage of 2 and 4-cell cleaving embryos. A numerical model of reproductive success as a function of adult density and current conditions will be used to assess potential population-level effects of observed changes in fertilization success. Results of this investigation will aid future studies on the effects of climate change on marine organisms and ecological stability of marine communities.","4152":"Broadly distributed species may adapt to local temperature conditions such that isolated populations have different thermal tolerance ranges than the species as a whole. Therefore, to accurately predict how species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 ranges will be affected by global climate change, bioclimate models would benefit from knowing the thermal tolerance of different populations within latitudinally distributed species. In this study, the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model system to study how local adaptation influences the cold resistance of isolated populations. Among five populations spanning 18 degrees in latitude, two metrics were used to compare cold tolerance: post-freezing recovery and the temperature of chill coma onset (CTmin). Recovery rates following freezing were faster in copepods from colder northern latitudes. Likewise, northern populations exhibited lower chill coma onset temperatures. Importantly, both metrics showed a consistent latitudinal trend suggesting that any single metric could be used equivalently in future studies investigating latitudinal variation in cold tolerance. Our results provide evidence that populations within a single species can display strong local adaptation to spatially varying climatic conditions. Thus it would be valuable for bioclimate models to account for local adaptation when forecasting biological responses to climate change.","4153":"Organisms can develop normally and thrive in dynamic environments. The interplay between the environment and the biomechanics of morphogenesis can help us understand how development operates in a changing world. Effects of salinity on blastula expansion in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus were used to investigate interactions among the environment, development, and mechanics. Salinity fluctuations, which are common in Dendraster's habitat, affect embryonic cell size. The hyaline layer, an extracellular matrix layer closely associated with the outside of the blastula, is hypothesized to resist blastula expansion. Four models describing how the hyaline layer responds to blastula expansion were compared. In three models the hyaline resists expansion as either an elastic, plastic, or viscous layer. In these models, salinity-driven changes in cell size were predicted to cause changes in the ratio of blastocoel volume to cell volume. In a fourth model, the hyaline is a perfectly accommodating layer that allows the embryo to expand freely as cells divide in a single layer. In this model, salinity changes were predicted not to affect the blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratio. To test these hypotheses, Dendraster embryos were placed in either 25\u201a\u00c4\u221e or 32\u201a\u00c4\u221e seawater wells and switched to wells of either the same or the other salinity. In a second experiment, Dendraster embryos were raised in 32\u201a\u00c4\u221e seawater until the 16-cell stage, at which point a subset of embryos were moved to 25\u201a\u00c4\u221e seawater for one cleavage stage and then moved back to 32\u201a\u00c4\u221e for the duration of the experiment. In both experiments blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratios were not affected by the salinity treatment. These results suggest that the hyaline layer does not resist blastula expansion in Dendraster, thereby maintaining a constant blastocoel-to-cell-volume ratio, despite salinity variation.","4154":"The powerful and aggressive feeding habits of various shark species are clear indications that individuals are capable of applying incredible force to their prey. Sharks have been known to crush hard bone and shell (Wroe et al., 2008), and are notorious for their ability to attack and crush large prey. As cartilaginous fishes lacking any hard bone, we sought to study how the jaws of these chondrichthyans are able to withstand such intense pressure while continuing to remain functional and supportive. Of the various cartilages of the jaw, we identified the hyomandibular cartilage of the hyoid arch as our primary focus. The hyoid arch is a modified gill arch that acts as a hinge between the upper and lower jaws (Maisey, 1980). This cartilage is particularly significant as it helps suspend the jaw and allows the other elements of the jaw to function properly and effectively. Differences in pressure of the buccal cavity and pressure produced by the jaw during feeding vary in different types of chondrichthyans. Chondrichthyans feed either by suction feeding, bite feeding, or a mix of both, and jaw structure is crucial to determining which behaviors are implemented (Tomtia et al., 2011). The arrangement of the hyoid arch and the surface area of the cartilages that make up the hyoid arch can help determine what type of feeding a shark uses. For example, by calculating which cartilages have the largest surface area, the relative stiffness of the jaw can be estimated, therefore indicating the most probable type of feeding (Wilga 2008). Cartilage stiffness was tested to determine whether stronger ceratohyal cartilage was present in sharks that suction feed. The stronger the cartilages were, the more force they could withstand during the high pressures that occur during suction (Tomita et al., 2011). The hyoid area, the area made by the opening of the hyoid arch, can provide further insight into the determination of shark feeding (Wilga, 2008). There are five main shapes and orientations of the hyoid in chondrichthyans. They include a posteriorly oriented hyoid, an anteriorly oriented hyoid, and a short, laterally oriented hyoid. Particular positioning and shape of this feature directly affects the size of the jaw opening and buccal cavity. Posteriorly oriented hyoids allow for a very large and wide bite, and are seen in bite feeders. Short, lateral hyoid positions are well suited for cutting back and forth, but do not allow for as large of a bite. This small area creates a better setting for suction feeding and helps create stronger negative pressure inside the buccal cavity to draw in prey. Anteriorly oriented hyoids swing the jaw open much wider so the most amount of water and prey possible can flow into the buccal cavity. This is more often seen in ram and filter feeders (Wilga, 2008). Difference in hyoid orientation is an important distinguishing feature to recognize and can help connect jaw mechanics to ecological scenarios.","4155":"Rockfish are a predatory fish often found in the rocky terrain and quick currents of the San Juan channel. They are an active area of study for marine scientists, many seeking to know their food sources for commercial and ecological purposes. The populations of rockfish have been on the decline in the Salish Sea. However, since they are a predatory fish, their trophic interactions are much more difficult to study for conservation purposes. One possible interaction to observe is with a well\u201a\u00c4\u00eaknown species of octopus, the giant pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dolfleini). The largest of the octopus species, the GPO (giant pacific octopus) is found in the colder habitats of the northern Pacific, living and hunting in rocky areas. They often bring the prey back to their dens or hunt very close to their dens, creating a flurry of prey tissues and juices, leaving behind midden piles full of leftover food for scavengers. When feeding, the GPO will inject paralyzing venom, liquefying the prey as they rip it apart. The octopus pushes out the pile of rubbish and prey remains from the den to keep its area clean. This flurry of feeding activity creates a prime food source for multiple scavengers and potential prey of the rockfish. Larger fish (such as rockfish) often hunt the scavengers eating among the midden piles; preferring benthic crustaceans, and shrimp. Our aim is to observe whether rockfish take advantage of this phenomenon. We hypothesize that rockfish have a direct feeding relationship with GPOs, using the octopus den as the hub of feeding activity.","4156":"Determining predictors of Balanophyllia elegans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 population distribution and physical size is important for ecological research in the Eastern Pacific because changes in this species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 biomass, abundance, and environment could be an indication of realized impact from climate change and ocean acidification. Over the last four decades community composition has changed around the San Juan Islands, including a decline in B. elegans\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 density. In this study we assessed abundance, biomass, population density, largest diameter, and surface area at 11 sites from the years 2008-2013, at depths ranging from 3 m to 27.5 m with 3 m increments, and at four flow ranks, looking for patterns and predictors. We found that all three variables (site, year, and depth) and the interaction variables \u201a\u00c4\u00f2site + depth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and \u201a\u00c4\u00f2site + year + depth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 are statistically significant predictors for coral distribution, and year, depth, and the interaction term \u201a\u00c4\u00f2year + site\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 are significant predictors for oral disc surface area. These results tell us that these sites are unique, but each site has an interesting pattern that will need to be defined through further analysis for a larger sample size.","4157":"This project explored and analyzed the strain and structure of elasmobranch jaws, particularly the hyoid arch. The cartilaginous element tested was the hyomandibula in four individuals each of the angel shark, Squatina squatina, spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, and sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus. We put them through trials that tested for strain and we performed geometric morphometric analyses on the results. ! Chondrichthyans have a modified gill arch called the hyoid arch that they use during prey capture and mastication. In all our tested shark species, the cartilaginous hyoid arch expands the buccal cavity. This expansion functions to create negative pressure in the mouth to draw in prey for suction feeders, and allows a wide buccal area to take in as much prey as possible for bite feeders. The hyoid arch in elasmobranchs consists of the ceratohyal, basihyal, and hyomandibula cartilages. The hyomandibula is significant since it connects the ceratohyal to the chondrocranium, connecting functions of the upper and lower jaws. ! Teleosts and elasmobranchs evolved different jaw structures, especially in the hyoid region: teleosts have craniums ossified with dermal bone, with the hyoid arch incorporated into the suspensorium and opercular series. The hyoid expands laterally in teleosts, as shown in previous research with Amia calva and Micropterus salmoides (Wilga 2008), while it compresses in elasmobranchs, except in mako and sandbar sharks (Wilga 2008). Lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks have long, posteriorly oriented hyomandibulae to make room for a wide buccal cavity. Previous research done on buccal pressure shows that lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks do not rely much on suction feeding, but rather on bite feeding (Wilga 2008). Suction feeders, in particular the whitespotted bamboo shark, laterally compress their buccal cavity to generate negative pressure to draw the prey in (Wilga &amp; Sanford 2008). Even the very large megamouth shark uses negative pressure by pulling its basihyal cartilage posteriorly and ventrally rotating its hyoid arch to expand its buccal cavity (Tomita et al 2011). ! All chondrichthyan skeletons are cartilaginous, yet many readily feed on bony teleosts. Some, like the Horned shark, Heterodontus francisci, are durophagous, even with cartilaginous jaws (Huber et al. 2005). Since cartilage is more malleable than bone, the question is brought up as to how chondrichthyans can feed on durable, hard prey with cartilaginous jaws. Hence, our project focuses on the strain levels of the hyoid arch elements in sharks and rays. We tested the hyoid arch since it swings the lower jaw ventrally from the chondrocranium to expand the buccal cavity and experiences much of the pressure from mastication. ! We also examined cartilage mineralization. One suggestion in literature was that the mineralization of cartilage makes it stiffer and therefore more resistant to strain (Porter et al. 2007). Mineralization occurs in chondrichthyan jaws as prismatic or globular calcification in the form of blocks called tesserae. They form around the perichondrium, the outer layer of the extracellular matrix (Dean and Summers 2006). Since the calcified tesserae add another layer to the cartilage, one of our hypotheses was that cartilage elements with more mineralization would be more resistant to strain than those that had a thinner layer of mineralization. ! Our second hypothesis was that shorter, more square-like hyomandibulae would deform less than longer, thinner hyomandibulae. We obtained data on hyomandibulae shape by measuring their length and cross-sectional areas, and used length data to test this hypothesis. We predicted that long, thin specimens had more area to deform than short, squat specimens, leading to a higher Poisson\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ratio of strain. Our third hypothesis was that mineralized area and hyomandibula cross-sectional area were correlated, since a thicker layer of mineralization would add to the extracellular matrix area of the cartilage. Significant correlations would suggest that larger hyomandibulae are more resistant to strain than smaller ones.","4158":"Many stress factors affect energy budgets of species in the intertidal zone Specifically, mussels must distribute energy between processes such as attachment, shell growth, metabolism, and reproduction, all of which may be influenced not only by seasonality, but also by anthropogenic stressors. Understanding patterns of energy distribution between biologic processes is critical when deriving energy budgets of intertidal organisms. In the present study, we investigated the energetic cost of byssus production for the intertidal mussel Mytilus trossulus. Methods were established and administered for a four-week period, which involved exposing collected mussels to one of three, triplicate, treatments respectively. Treatments included: \u201a\u00c4\u00faNever\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 removing byssus, \u201a\u00c4\u00faWeekly\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 byssus removal, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faDaily\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 byssus removal. Using statistical analyses, changes in physical measurements (ie. length, width, and height), gonadosomatic index, and condition index were assessed. We identified a low amount of byssus production for mussels in the \u201a\u00c4\u00faNever\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 treatment, which corresponded to a lesser percent change in length (shell growth) in comparison to the other treatments. Therefore mussels may shift their energetics from producing longer shells and tissue growth toward applying a greater amount of energy in byssus production. Combined with modeling predictions, this information will be useful for aquaculture practices as well as understanding physical changes mussels undergo in response to stressors that impact byssus production.","4159":"Though reef corals are heavily studied, little is known about temperate, solitary corals. We studied the distribution, size and abundance of Balanophyllia elegans in the San Juan Islands at 11 sites. Our methods consisted of analyzing photos from Madrona Tree and White Sign to determine the distributions of size and abundance at these two sites. We also looked at the effect of flow on coral size and density. We found that the distributions of B. elegans vary by site and depth and year. Corals have the highest density at high flow sites and the highest biomass at very high flow sites. Average coral size and biomass increased over time. Our findings call for future research on this San Juan species.","4160":"The San Juan Channel, Washington is home to a diverse seastar community, which includes the blood star (Henricia spp.). Few studies have examined the characteristics of the blood star and those have sought to identify morphological difference among species. In this study we examined the spatial and temporal distribution, size, and abundance of the blood star within the San Juan Channel in the San Juan Archipelago. Six locations and 95 transects were established at different depths and using SCUBA, blood stars were photographed and measured. Analysis demonstrated that there was a significant difference in spatial and temporal distributions. Understanding these distributions and investigating the potential factors for the differences is the next step in determining if the causes are natural or anthropogenic.","4161":"Phytoplankton are the base of the marine food web. They have a rapid cell growth and reproduction and can produce million of cell per liters of seawater. Phytoplankton account for 95% of primary production. In the San Juan Channel, changes in phytoplankton abundance and composition is interesting because the physical condition of the ocean give dynamics between the nutrients and the plankton. The study site is in the San Juan Channel on the weekly R\/V Centennial cruise. Phytoplanktons were collected using 80\uf8ff\u00f9\u00fa\u00e1n net in 30 m deep water, then preserved in formalin. The top 5 genera for phytoplankton this year are Ditylum, Coscinodiscus, Skeletonema and Asterionellopsis. There are one instance where two out of five genera were abundant and there were some episodic bloom in two events. Overall, this yeat the phytoplankton were abundant over the beginning of fall and decline over the course of the fall quarter.","4162":"The San Juan Channel links the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and is dominated by an estuarine flow regime. For fall 2013, Pelagic Ecosystem Function Research Apprenticeship sampled a 5-station transect along the San Juan Channel. A CTD was deployed and temperature, salinity, and density data were collected. From these data, channel structure could be deduced, and contour plots were created to help extrapolate out the trends. Water and air temperature decreased throughout autumn. Short-term channel salinity and density structure was modulated by tides and winds. Density stratification was highest at South Station and North Station stratification was greatest when the freshwater signal was strongest. The depth of the pycnocline at South Station was not correlated to tidal height. However, when data points were separated by tidal cycle, there was a correlation between neap tide\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pycnocline depth and tidal height. Also, finer temporal resolution analysis of the northern channel salinity structure revealed that there is extensive within channel variation, and that salinity is regulated by tidal phase and cycle, as well as winds. The temperature, salinity and density structure patterns presented within this study, strengthens our understanding of their physical drivers within the San Juan Channel.","4163":"Forage fish, such as the Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) occupy a critical intermediate trophic level characteristic of wasp waist food webs. Though Pacific sand lance (PSL) are prey to numerous organisms, little research has been conducted on the trophic ecology of PSL in the San Juan Channel (Salish Sea, Washington, USA). This study examined PSL prey fields in the San Juan Channel (SJC), as well as short term dietary patterns of the PSL during the autumn of 2013. Additionally, this study aims to characterize both long term nutrient assimilation and trophic position of PSL in the SJC using stable isotope analysis (SI). Zooplankton sampling revealed that PSL prey field composition was similar for all sites sampled. Results indicated that zooplankton composition and abundance in the SJC is influenced by environmental drivers including wind and tidal cycle. Gut content analysis revealed that PSL fed preferentially upon calanoid copepods. Secondary prey items included harpacticoid and cyclopoid copepods (20%), and amphipods (13%). There were no significant diel dietary patterns, but there were interannual differences, including the lack of larvaceans and copepod nauplii in 2013 gut contents. The results of SI have not been received at this time.","4164":"Seabirds are an important component of many marine ecosystems, but are in decline in many parts of the world. While some studies have shown that Salish Sea seabirds are declining, PEF has found no evidence of this decline. I attempted to characterize the seabird community of fall 2013, as well as try to establish whether or not tidal influences have been biasing our data collection. I used strip transect survey methods to analyze the seabird community of 2013 and compare it to previous years, and looked at three tidal metrics (tidal current speed, tidal current direction, and maximum tidal exchange) to determine whether or not PEF has a sampling bias in regards to tides. The abundance of seabirds in 2013 was relatively low, but not anomalously so, and the community composition for this year is consistent with that of past years. Furthermore, analyses of the tidal metrics yielded no evidence of sampling bias. Therefore, it is likely that the interannual patterns observed by PEF in the past are real and are possibly due to global climate patterns.","4165":"Ammodytes hexapterus or Pacific sand lance (PSL) are forage fish that spend most of their time buried in benthic substrate (Robards 1999). PSL exhibit a peculiar behavior of actively swimming into sandy substrates as a refuge to avoid predation (Gidmark et al. 2010, Robards 1999, Blaine 2006). A sand wave field was identified in the San Juan Channel, WA in 2004 and discovered to be a suitable habitat for PSL. The San Juan Channel sand wave field is non-uniform and is composed of different substrate types. While physical attributes of the sand wave field have been explored (Greene et al. 2011), there is little known about how PSL use various substrate types as habitat. I am asking the question: How does benthic substrate composition influence the abundance and distribution of Pacific sand lance in the San Juan Channel sand wave? Samples were collected from the San Juan Chanel sand wave with the use of a Van Veen grab. The abundance and size of PSL were examined in each grab as well as the substrate composition. There were apparent trends of PSL abundance decreasing as the amount of gravel increased, and increasing as the amount of sand increased in the sample (Fig 1). Substrate composition seems to not have an influence on PSL size (Fig 3, Fig 4). A map showing the different substrate compositions in different areas of the sand wave in 2013 shows the non-uniform composition of the sand wave (Fig 6).","4166":"Intricate tidal dynamics are the main drivers of ecosystem processes in coastal estuaries. Previous Pelagic Ecosystem Function studies have explored the relationship between tidal activity and seabird abundance in the San Juan Channel, Washington, but no strong or consistent temporal patterns were found. My objectives were to investigate: the fine scale temporal changes in bird abundance over the flooding tidal cycle; taxa specific responses to tides; and the influence of other environmental factors on variation among days and between years. I did this through sampling seabird abundance at half-hour intervals during the flooding tide on four consecutive days in the fall of 2013. Seabird abundance results showed consistent response to tidal phase for total birds and alcids in both 2013 and 2012. Variation between years suggested different foraging strategies were used by local gulls based on a change in feeding conditions. Additionally, the variation between years was related to large-scale oceanographic conditions, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The differences in tidal response between taxa and between years suggests that fine temporal scale sampling can provide more insight into previously undetected factors affecting seabird abundance. Based on the results of this study, fine scale sampling can provide better predicting power and thus more informed decisions for management and conservation.","4167":"In the southern San Juan Channel, flood tides bring an influx of cold, saline oceanic water, while warmer, fresher water flows out of the channel on ebb tides. Variation in tidal conditions thus has important effects on the physical properties of the water in the channel. The objective of this study was to measure these effects on both slack-flood and spring-neap scales of tidal variation. To accomplish this, measurements of physical water properties were taken repeatedly in the same location over the course of a flood tide on four consecutive days. Water density was found to increase as the flood tide progressed within each day, and also as tidal condition changed from neap to spring over the course of the four days. Data taken under similar tidal and seasonal conditions in 2012 did not show the same strong relationship, but given unusually cold water temperatures present in the channel in 2012, this is not inconsistent with the previously stated model of how tidal input affects physical water properties.","4168":"The Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) is an ecologically important forage fish in the Salish Sea serving as a link between secondary consumers and top predators. In this study we investigated variation in length, stomach fullness, condition factor, and catch per unit effort (CPUE) through the fall season in 2013 in order to infer the timing of overwintering dormancy. We also tested for differences between locations. Population structure and variation through the fall season were compared between populations at the San Juan Channel wave field and Jackson Beach and between past year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s findings (2006, 2010, 2012). The wave field population was significantly larger and was in greater condition than the population at Jackson Beach. Through the fall season for the wave field population: length remained stabled, stomach fullness remained stable, condition factor declined, and CPUE remained stable. For the Jackson Beach population: length remained stable, stomach fullness declined, condition factor remained stable, and CPUE decline. These results suggest an earlier shift into overwintering dormancy for the wave field population compared to Jackson Beach.","4169":"The San Juan Channel (SJC) lies within the Salish Sea between Washington state, USA and British Columbia, Canada. As an estuary, the physical oceanographic conditions of the SJC change constantly over small and large periods of time. It is important to understand how and why these changes occur in order to understand what influences the biota of the SJC. The purpose of this study was to determine the physical oceanographic conditions of 2013, compare them to the 10 previous years of PEF research, and to evaluate the effect of external drivers. The external drivers evaluated were the discharge of the Fraser River, the fall transition from upwelling to downwelling, El Ni\u221a\u00b1o Pacific Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Weekly cruises were conducted during the fall of 2013, during which a CTD was used to measure temperature and salinity and to collect water samples for the determination of dissolved oxygen. Results revealed that the Fraser River influence on salinity was heavily affected by wind direction and strength, though the fall transition did not occur within our study period. Additionally, both ENSO and the PDO contribute to seawater temperature and the NPGO was loosely correlated with surface dissolved oxygen. The fall of 2013 was a year that clearly showed multiple sources influencing one physical oceanographic characteristic.","4170":"Salinity fluctuations are common in the Salish Sea of the Pacific Northwest and are expected to become more common as global warming continues to increase the rate of glacial melting. The salinity can drop down to as low as 20\u201a\u00c4\u221e from the normal level of 30\u201a\u00c4\u221e in these fluctuations which usually occur during the summer months when many marine invertebrates are reproducing. Especially affected are echinoderms since they lack the ability to osmo- or ionregulate. In this study we investigated the effects of fluctuating salinity on protein expression in larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus and the seastar Pisaster ochraceus. Adults were spawned and larvae were reared in 2 treatments: control (constant salinity of 29-30\u201a\u00c4\u221e) and fluctuating salinity (FS, salinity dropped to 21\u201a\u00c4\u221e for 2 day periods every ~7 days). Samples were taken periodically, analyzed for protein content by the Bradford Assay, and separated by SDS PAGE to look for differences in banding patterns. A number of differences in protein expression were discovered in both P. ochraceus and D. excentricus larvae exposed to fluctuating salinity but the exact identity of these proteins are not known until mass spectrometry is completed. The proteins that differed likely function in metabolism, skeletogenesis, ion transport, or muscle growth.","4171":"Intertidal hermit crabs of Puget Sound include Pagurus hirsutiusculus, Pagurus granosimanus, and Pagurus beringanus. The behavior of Pagurus hirsutiusculus differs from that of the other two species in terms of shell selection, escape locomotion, and reactions to predators. Measurements of shells and hermit crab\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s occupying them were taken. Both P. granosimanus and P. beringanus were found to select crabs four times their body weight while P. hirsutiusculus chose shells that were slightly lighter than it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s body weight. However, gravid females of P. hirsutiusculus choose shells twice their weight. Shell release is a unique behavior in P. hirsutiusculus in which the crab will let go of it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s shell when picked up the shell and fall out. This behavior was tested for on the other species of the intertidal, but it was found that only a large percentage of P. hirsutiusculus display this behavior. Gravid females of P. hirsutiusculus were less likely to display shell release behavior. Behavior between P. granosimanus and P. hirsutiusculus in presence of a predator was drastically different. P. hirsutiusculus recovered twice as quickly from being startled than P. granosimanus. There was no significant difference in control or predator water for either hermit crab in Cancer productus water. In Cancer magister water, there was only a significant difference in P. hirsutiusculus which went significantly slower. In P. helianthoides water, only P. granosimanus had significantly different behavior in that it recovered faster than in control water.","4172":"The vertebral column plays an essential role in body stiffness and swimming. Greater body stiffness results in greater mechanical outputs from the body on the environment. Previous work in bioinspired systems has shown that changing the length of the intervertebral joint changes the mechanics of the whole column. Our goals were to test the effects of centrum morphology and intervertebral joint length on mechanical outputs of the vertebral column using bioinspired models. We expected that centrum angle, joint length, and bending angle would all be significant effects in our statistical models. We designed five 3-D models inspired by vertebral morphology of fishes, humans, and marine mammals, and models were printed on a 3-D printer. We constructed 12 motion segments (centrum \u201a\u00c4\u00ec joint \u201a\u00c4\u00ec centrum) of varying joint length for each centrum morphology. A moment arm was added to one end of the motion segment to insure pure bending and eliminate shear. We tested mechanical properties of motion segments on a materials testing system measuring force (N). From the force outputs we calculated moment (Nm), Work (J), and Bending Stiffness (Nm2). Increasing the bending angle during testing, increased the moment and work produced by the system, while it decreased the bending stiffness. By increasing joint length we measured decreases in each of those mechanical properties. The marine marine mammal models, regardless of joint length, always had the largest mechanical outputs while the fish model with an intermediate centrum angle had the lowest. These data suggest that convex and flat models are consistently stiffer than concave models. Our data show the relation between centrum shape, joint length, and their associated mechanical outputs is perhaps not linear. Building additional models will allow us to further explore morphospace and better understand the conserved centrum shapes we see in among vertebrate groups. This research was funded by NSF grant DBI 1262239.","4173":"Aggregations can form due to resource limitations but can be potentiated by group benefits or for temporary mate selection. Maritime earwigs, Anisolabis maritima, are insects found in aggregations under beach debris in most temperate and tropical regions. Cohabitation is thought to be due to resource limitation but no studies have thus been done. This study compared size, sex and shelter as determinants in cohabitation. Cohabitation was found to be only preferred among different sized males when shelter is absent. Females preferred not to cohabitate in most cases but were more tolerant of cohabitating with males. Shelters played a key role in encouraging separate living which may indicate it is a limited shared resource.","4174":"Organisms have to behave within the range of mechanical properties of their body. Leptosynapta clarki, collected from False Bay, San Juan Island, WA, exhibited undocumented elongation behavior that might be associated with burrowing. In this paper the elongation ability, the elongation mechanisms, and the role of the body wall in elongation in Leptosynapta claki were studied. L. clarki elongated on the average of 2.85 times of its minimum length. L. clarki without tentacles elongated less than L. clarki with intact tentacles and was not able to burrow in to sediment. Indicating that the primary mechanism of elongation was the movement of oral tentacles. The tests performed on intact cylindrical body wall and cut, strips of body wall indicated that viscoelastic properties of L. clarki body wall were disrupted when the body wall was cut longitudinally and internal organs were removed. Since the maximum strain from mechanical testing and natural range of extension were very close, it is possible that L. clarki was opering at its maximum capacity of the body wall.","4175":"Sessile animals of the intertidal contend with a different set of challenges based on the height at which they live in the intertidal. An abundant intertidal species of the Pacific Northwest is the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. This species forms colonies of genetically identical individuals and has been shown to enact an aggressive response to nonclonemates using specialized battle tentacles known as acrorhagi. We sampled twenty clones from the lower intertidal and twenty from the higher intertidal and battled and analyzed their battles against a single opponent clone. Individual analyses of battle metrics showed no significant difference between the behavior of higher intertidal clones and lower intertidal clones. However, a holistic analysis that looked at the more aggressive respondent, on average, indicated lower intertidal clones were more aggressive. There were significantly more acrorhagi present in animals from the lower intertidal than those in the higher intertidal. We pose the questions of possible increased fighting efficiency in higher intertidal clones and potential phenotypic plasticity in the anemone that may enable any settling larva to adopt an appropriate level of energy allocation to aggressiveness in balance with the physical demands of the higher intertidal. We plan to continue developing aggression metrics and analyzing anemone behavior post-battle.","4176":"The Earth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s magnetic field is often used by a variety of animals as a navigational tool. Animals may use their compass navigation to fix their position and determine their direction of movement. Oftentimes, a variety of complementary tools like, celestial cues may be used to assist compass navigation (Hill et al. 2012). These navigational abilities can promote reproductive success, food acquisition, and effective migration. While compass navigation and orientation behavior has been well studied in birds (Wiltschko &amp; Wiltschko 1972), sea turtles (Lohmann 1991), and other organisms, the underlying neural basis of these behaviors is less understood. In investigating the neurophysiology of vertebrate navigation, the animal is restrained and thus limited in exhibiting typical migratory behavior. Additionally, the complexity of vertebrate brain structure makes it difficult to identify specific neurons and neural circuits involved in navigation. The large nudibranch mollusk, Tritonia tetraquetra is known to orient to the Earth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s magnetic field (Lohmann and Willows 1987). It has been hypothesized that T. tetraquetra use their magnetic sense in response to situations when primary navigational cues become undependable (Wyeth 2010). T. tetraquetra uses odor-gated rheotaxis (OGR) to detect predators, mates, and prey (Wyeth &amp; Willows 2006). But, sometimes before the slug reaches the source of the odor, the odor plume may dissipate due to varying water flow direction. The slug may then benefit from switching to a secondary navigational tool, such as, magnetoreception (Wyeth 2010) when the odor cue is lost. T. tetraquetra is a good model for studying the behavior and neural basis of navigation and magnetic sensing. Their navigational distances are short compared to Morgan D. Linney 3 other animals, allowing behavioral experiments to be done in the lab. Additionally, they have a centralized nervous system with large orange and white neurons that make them easy to visualize and identify (Willows 1971). The majority of their neurons have been mapped and characterized. Past studies of the neural basis of T. tetraquetra magnetic sensing has begun to identify key neurons and potential uses of this navigational tool (Lohmann et al. 1991).","4177":"Intertidal marine seaweeds experience different environmental conditions during high and low tides. Low tide conditions may be stressful for seaweeds because desiccation and extreme light levels may impact their ability to photosynthesize. We examined the effect of low tide exposure on the photosynthetic health of the canopy-forming seaweed Saccharina sessilis in the field and lab. Field studies assessed the health of marked individuals on days with varying environmental conditions, while lab studies separated the effects of those different conditions. We hypothesized that the seaweed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s photosynthetic health depended on weather. We predicted that health would decline over a single stressful low tide (high light, high wind, and high temperature), but not over a benign low tide (low light, low wind, and moderate temperature). We assessed health in multiple ways. First, we measured dark-adapted Maximum Quantum Yield (MQY) via pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry, which assesses the photosynthetic ability of Photosystem II. Second, because we observed that the seaweed changes color following intense stress, we evaluated tissue damage by quantifying the proportion of blade area in five color categories. A single stressful low tide can reduce MQY readings to 25% of pre-exposure values and damage 60% of a blade\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s area. Individuals in benign conditions had MQY values of 97% of pre-exposure values and only 1% of blade area damage. Over the long term, damage from low tide exposure may limit growth and reproductive output. Understanding how individuals and populations respond to daily stresses will aid in understanding their response over longer time scales.","4178":"The intertidal zone experiences different abiotic conditions during high and low tide. Low tide stressors include, but are not limited to, temperature fluctuations and wind desiccation. Saccharina sessilis provides a canopy for intertidal animals to escape to during these warm, stressful low tides. Some of these animals include herbivores of S. sessilis : K. tunicata, I. wosnesenskii, and Lacuna species snails. This macroalgae will accumulate damage over a tide series. The focus of this study looks at whether being damaged will alter S. sessilis susceptibility to herbivory. First we assessed S. sessilis risk of herbivory in the field at Pile Point, WA by counting the number of S. sessilis, K. tunicata, I. wosnesenskii, and Lacuna in a given area in the S. sessilis zone. Next, we carried out stress\/no stress trials where we simulated a low tide and either desiccated samples of S. sessilis or left them out of water. Both treatments lasted either 60 or 90 minutes. Area, wet weight, and percent brown were measured before and after each simulation Data showed the stressed samples lost more mass, area, and accumulated more visible damage than the not stressed samples. We then put these paired samples though herbivory trials in a container without herbivores or with a set of herbivores (K. tunicata, or I. wosnesenskii). Once 50% of the S. sessilis tissue in the herbivore container was consumed, the trial was terminated for the pair of containers. The area and wet weight of the remaining tissue was measured before and after the herbivore trials. Analysis showed that K. tunicata preferred damaged S. sessilis tissue over undamaged tissue and that I. wosnesenskii had no preference for damaged or undamaged S. sessilis tissue. Overall, we conclude that repeated wind exposure leads to shrinking algae, and ultimately their algal canopy. We also conclude that S.sessilis\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s susceptibility to herbivory is sensitive to the differences of the feeding preferences of its herbivores.","4179":"Preliminary studies suggest that salinity concentrations affect the developmental defect known as exogastrulation in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. Gastrulation is a very important morphological change as the vegetal plate of an embryo buckles inward to form the archenteron, which eventually forms the larval gut. However, successful gastrulation isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t always the case and defects arise. A defect known as exogastrulation occurs when exposed to particular pollutants. A calcium deficient environment is one of those stimuli that can induce exogastrulation. In this study, embryos were exposed to varying salinity and calcium conditions and the archenteron lengths were measured near the end of the gastrulation process. The blastocoel and cell layer volumes were also collected to determine if the blastocoel was expanding at the same rate that the cell layer was expanding at. It was hypothesized that the rate of expansion would be a causing factor for whether an organism underwent successful gastrulation or exogastrulated. The results suggest that salinity does not have an effect on the sensitivity to the exogastrulation defect.","4180":"Inducible phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s genotype to express different observable traits or phenotypes, such as morphology, over and individual\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s lifespan. The snails Lacuna vincta and L. variegata produce two different tooth morphologies, blunt or pointed, depending on their diet. They are found in two habitats, eelgrass and macroalgae. We tested whether there are different chemical cues from macroalgae, a kelp in this case, diatoms, or Zostra marina, eelgrass, that trigger different tooth morphologies in these two species of Lacuna to understand what induces the change in phenotype. Changes in tooth morphology during the experiment was different for snails from two source locations, False Bay, an eelgrass bed, and Pile Point, which is dominated by macroalgae, which may reflect different prior environmental variability or stability. Most animals of both species produced pointed teeth on the neutral diet of lettuce, as well as when fed kelp or eelgrass, suggesting this is a default morphology, and blunt tooth production requires a cue for production. Our data suggest that alginate is not a neutral carrier for food, and affected the rate of tooth change. Further experimentation is needed to determine if diatoms produce chemical cues that trigger blunt teeth.","4181":"For signals in nature to be honest, they have to provide information about the sender\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s body condition, size, or reproductive quality. The plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) is a model for the study of acoustic signals due to their importance in its social and reproductive behavior. In order to test whether larger males produce louder and lower frequency calls, males were recorded at night and subsequently measured. Overall, loudness of the mate call was significantly positively correlated with body size and swim bladder volume. Body size and swim bladder volume were also significantly correlated with frequency of the first five harmonics; however this correlation was positive. Loudness of the second and the third harmonic relative to the first harmonic also increase with body size and tend to be louder than or the same as the fundamental frequency in larger males. Based on preliminary data, the plainfin midshipman does seem to exhibit honest signals that provide information about the sender\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s size, especially in regards to amplitude.","4182":"The Elwha River dam removal project is the largest such project carried out in the U.S., and offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of a sudden sediment flux from the river to the coastal environment. A huge amount of new littoral sediment has accumulated at the river mouth; however, it is unknown whether it will migrate eastward and accrete on the chronically eroding beaches, and on what timescales this will occur. In this study, grain-size data and beach elevation profiles were collected along three shore- perpendicular transects east of the river mouth in early March, and again for three consecutive days in mid-April, with the goal of observing short-term changes. Physical sediment samples were collected for grain-size analysis, CobbleCam autocorrelation was used to obtain mean grain size from digital photographs, and beach profiles were constructed for these periods of spring tides and large waves. Results indicate that the upper foreshore of the transect farthest from the river mouth (Line 198) lost up to 0.38 m of elevation between the two study periods, and the lower foreshore gained up to 0.41 m elevation. In addition, slope breaks on all transects migrated cross-shore, and foreshore sediments coarsened, both temporally (during the three-day April sampling period) and spatially (down the foreshore). These results demonstrate that daily changes can occur on the Elwha beaches. This study adds to our understanding of how new sediments will influence this region, and possibly of mixed grain-size beach dynamics in general.","4183":"Dam removal on the Elwha River has increased sediment concentrations in the buoyant river plume emptying into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Such increased turbidity can decrease light available for primary production in the water column and may negatively impact primary production, which could have bottom-up effects on the entire food chain. To investigate the effects of turbidity, sediment profiles, light profiles, and chlorophyll-a profiles from the delta were analyzed for both in-plume and out-of-plume stations. Differences in sediment concentration and light attenuation occurred between stations within and without of the plume, and trends suggest that mixing in the water column may enhance primary production within the plume.","4184":"New sediment is being released from the Elwha River dam reservoirs into the Strait of Juan de Fuca for the first time in 100 years, but it is unknown where this sediment will settle and how it will affect the geological environment. In this study, we examined the overall profile of the Elwha River delta and how it is influenced by the new sedimentation. Beach surveys, fathometer transects, and grain-size analyses were combined to evaluate the entire delta front. Grain-size and delta slopes were not found to be correlated in this study. The foreshore of the delta had the steepest slope and was comprised of sandy substrate. The low-tide terrace consisted of large cobbles and had a near horizontal slope. Offshore, the substrate varied widely but no relationship was found between substrate composition and slope. Profiles of the subaqueous delta revealed much longer topsets to the east of the river mouth, suggesting eastward littoral transport. Furthermore, three submarine ancient spits to the east of the delta demonstrate this historical transport pattern. One reason the substrate morphology of the Elwha delta does not look predicted is because the Elwha has been starved of sediment for the past century. Data from this study established a platform for further studies and hints at a future relationship that could be discovered.","4185":"The Elwha River dam removal project is expected to deliver fine grained sediment to the Elwha nearshore environment, thus potentially changing the substrate and affecting the macrobenthic invertebrate that inhabit it. This study looks at the relationship between grain size and macrobenthos. Grab samples were taken in April 2013 to evaluate for grain size and identify any invertebrates that were also picked up in the grab. The results were compared to those found prior to dam removal (2008) and that found in a similar study done spring 2012. Just outside of the river mouth, there were no benthos found and moving seaward numbers increased. Mud was found just outside the river mouth and to the west, and more sand was found in Freshwater Bay than had been prior to dam removal. Farther from the river mouth and to the east, there was mostly gravel and some sand, but little to no mud. It appears that in areas of higher gravel and sand fractions, there were more species found, as well as more total counts of benthos. In muddy areas there were little to no benthos found, which implies that the benthos are being smothered or migrating away from the areas with the most mud accumulation. This is an ongoing study and permanent effects on the benthic community are still unknown. However, this study concludes that during dam removal, the release of fine sediments will initially lower the presence of benthos near the river mouth.","4186":"Until twenty-five years ago, the sex determining factor in humans had yet to be identified. The Sox family of transcription factors were identified after the human sex-determining gene SRY was sequenced and compared to other genomes (Bowles et al., 2000). SOX genes have been discovered across the Metazoans but with varying function. Looking at related invertebrate organisms can offer insights into the primary gene function and the evolution of the gene. Echinoderm life cycles begin with a larval, bilaterally symmetric shape which then transforms into a radially symmetric juvenile\u201a\u00c4\u00eea radical metamorphosis! The role of Sox transcription factors in the process of metamorphosis has been described in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and in this project I will do research on metamorphosis with other echinoids to see if they are similar.","4187":"The TGF-\u0152\u2264 superfamily of signaling pathways is key in regulating embryonic development (Heldin et al. 2009). It is known to be present in all metazoan lineages (Huminiecki 2009). Studying this pathway in the ctenophore Pleurobrachia bachei may allow insights into the recent placement of ctenophores as the most basal metazoan lineage (Dunn et al. 2008). Studying Smad4 expression in embryos will determine where the TGF-\u0152\u2264 pathway is active during development. Adult P. bachei were collected from Friday Harbor Laboratories in Friday Harbor, WA. They were spawned; embryos collected, fixed and stained using whole mount antibody staining. Expression patterns revealed possible maternal derivatives of Smad4 in early stage embryos as well as possible use of the TGF-\u0152\u2264 pathway as a neurotransmitter in larvae that have finished development.","4188":"Cerebral gyrencephaly, distinguished by the convoluted folds and grooves in the cerebral cortex, occurs in many animals in Class Mammalia. The highest rates of cerebral gyrification occur in Order Cetacea within the Superorder Cetartiodactyla. Of all cetaceans, two members of Family Delphinidae, Orcinus orca (killer whales) and Tursiops truncatus (Atlantic bottlenose dolphins) have exceptionally high indices of cerebral gyrification. Research has shown that mutation in two genes, PAFAH1B1 and NDEL1, both located on human chromosome 17, disrupt gyrencephaly normally observed in human brains. Based on this research, PAFAH1B1 and NDEL1 were evaluated for positive selection in Orcinus orca and Tursiops truncatus, to test the hypothesis that these genes are undergoing adaptive evolution against the background of purifying selection. The results of multiple selection tests supported a set of null hypotheses, indicating that these genes were under purifying, not positive, selection, which supports the hypothesis that delphinid cerebral gyrification is not under the control of either PAFAH1B1 or NDEL1.","4189":"Although regeneration has been described in many deuterstomes, little is known about the molecular pathways involved in regeneration and cloning in the echinoderms (Rychel and Swalla, 2008). Larval cloning occurs in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus in the presence of predatory threat and food stress (Vaughn, 2007). The molecular pathways involved in the process of limb patterning in development and in cloning may be analogous (Mueoka and Bryant, 1982). The goal of this research project is to determine the role of Wnt expression in newly cloned larval Dendraster excentricus.","4190":"The formation of gill slits is a homologous trait in most deuterostomes (including hemichordates, tunicates, lancelets, and vertebrates), however is not present in the Phylum Echinodermata. Thus, there may be a difference in gene order or gene expression. The anterior Hox1 gene is responsible for gill slit formation (among other things), and is present in all deuterostomes, but perhaps in a different context. In this study, I performed phylogenetic analysis to determine how similar Hox1 was in echinoderms and hemichordates. My results show that they are divergent genes and therefore a laboratory experiment is possible. The next step would be to observe and compare Hox1 expression in both an echinoderm and a hemichordate.","4191":"The study explores the effect of diets of fresh and aged Agarum fimbriatum and Nereocystis luetkeana on the population growth of Tigriopus californicus. Fresh diets were expected to increase abundance, and the two algal species were expected to produce different sized populations. Founding populations of 30 gravid females were fed weekly a piece of one of 4 diets (fresh \/ aged x A. fimbriatum \/ N. luetkeana) for 32 days. Fresh N. luetkeana resulted in the largest population growth (1845 +\/-633.8) and fresh A. fimbriatum the smallest (521 +\/-32.5). This trend was consistent for the nauplius, copepodite and adult life stages, as well as the gravid female populations. Hatching rates were studied and significant differences were found among the treatments. Gravid females fed fresh N. luetkeana diets hatched eggs the fastest (15.7 hrs +\/- 12.4) and fresh A. fimbriatum the slowest (35.1 +\/-21.6). Polyphenolic anti-herbivory compounds in A. fimbriatum are suggested as the primary cause for the findings.","4192":"Do bacterial communities change as algae decays? If so, how does it change? Bacteria form many different types of relationships with algae and this study observed the effects of algal decay on bacterial abundance and composition on Nereocystis luetkeana and Agarum fimbriatum. I extracted and cultivated bacteria from algae collected in the San Juan Channel. I then counted colony numbers and monitored colony types based on morphological features. These observations are important for understanding feeding preferences of fresh vs. aged algae in nearshore organisms. If we can start to understand the relationship between decaying algae and the bacterial communities present on them, we can also start to understand the reason for food preference.","4193":"In the San Juan Islands, drift macrophytes from shallow waters represent a significant spatial subsidy provided to the subtidal zone. This organic matter is a potential food source for deep dwelling herbivores like the red urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. Little is known about how urchins capture and use drift material. A racetrack flume was used to examine the capture of drift macrophytes of various species and size by S. franciscanus. No species-specific selectivity was found, but urchins caught 100% of small macrophyte pieces. A significant decrease in capture efficiency was noted as drift algal size was increased, probably due to the urchins\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 inability to fight current drag acting on pieces with larger surface area.","4194":"The range and distribution of Nereocystis luetkeana kelp forests in the San Juan Islands have changed in the past 100 years. Urchin removal experiments designed to test the paradigm of top-down control of kelp forests by urchins in the San Juan Channel showed no significant differences in macroalgal density or community composition after urchins were removed, suggesting that grazing by other invertebrates may control kelp populations. Few studies have been completed on the effects of grazing by crabs like Pugettia producta on kelp forest communities. A caging experiment was conducted over 15 days in the field to compare the grazing impacts of P. producta to those of mesograzers in the kelp forest canopy on juvenile Nereocystis sporophytes. Six types of blocks were suspended off the Friday Harbor Labs breakwater in triplicate. Kelps were attached to blocks with 1) two different closed cages with 13 mm and 50 mm mesh, 2) two different open cages with 13 mm and 50 mm mesh, 3) a 13 mm mesh cage with an individual P. producta, or 4) no cage and exposed to grazing. At the end of the experiment, the ampithoid amphipod Peramphithoe was the most commonly seen mesograzer associated with the blocks. Significant differences in kelp mass and area change were observed between control blocks and crab-only blocks, implying that individual P. producta have a much greater impact on juvenile sporophyte survival than canopy mesograzers associated with the blocks.","4195":"This study tested if intertidal snails Nucella ostrina would feel more stress after undergoing a heat treatment designed to simulate a low tide condition if they were fed or starved. Our predictions were that N. ostrina would recover more quickly from stress if they had recently eaten, possibly due to the metabolic energy available for tissue regeneration and thermotolerance from accessible heat shock proteins. Respiration rates were measured for snails that had undergone no heat treatment, then they were exposed to a heat treatment (30 degrees Celsius for one hour) and put back in a respiration chamber to once again measure their respiration rate. Half of the snails in the treatment had been constantly exposed to food for a full two weeks, while the other half had been starved for two weeks. We found no significant difference between fed and starved snails in terms of recovery from stress, as measured by respiratory rates. Both fed and starved snails appeared to have similar responses after being exposed to a heat treatment, which could be an indication that heat does not cause stress to snails or that respiration rate is a poor metric of stress levels.","4196":"How much effect does nutritional state have on the recovery time of Nucella ostrina from low tide stresses? We predicted that fed N. ostrina would recover faster from low tide stress than starved ones. Fed and starved snails were exposed to a simulated low tide situation for 1 hour, and then measured for recovery based on their respiration rates and behavior. There were no significant differences in relative respiration rates of recovery between fed and starved snails.","4197":"Drift algae are an important resource in marine food webs and undergo a vital change in chemical composition during the degrading (or aging) process. I investigated the effects of aging algae and different species of algae on the Assimilation Efficiency (AE) of Idotea wosnesenskii, a grazing isopod found on San Juan Island. One week feeding (3 days) and starving (4 days) treatments were run with daily fecal matter collection. Weights of algae fed to isopods over 3 days and fecal matter subsequently produced were used to determine AE. The data show that in an alga with high levels of secondary metabolites, AE increased with algal age. This was not the case with another alga with few defensive chemicals, suggesting that aging causes a change in chemical composition, which increases AEs. Food preference was correlated with AE, as the preferred fresh algal species also had a higher AE. This study provides further support for why drift algae is important in food webs.","4198":"Spatial subsidies play a significant role in nearshore ecosystems. In the form of drift algae, these subsidies are not only important to larger herbivores but also smaller invertebrates as a food source. The goal of this study is to test red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) feces as acceptable food items and see if there is a preference of algal type. Feeding the green shore crab (Hemigrapsus oregonensis) fecal pellets from red sea urchins that have consumed Nereocystis luetkeana, Mazzaella splendens, and Ulva spp, there was no preference of species in fecal matter. Using a control of feeding the green shore crabs blades of the algae types, there was a preference of Nereocystis, but more importantly a preference of fecal pellets over undigested algae was seen.","4199":"Kelp forests are an integral part of complex marine food webs, and it is important to be aware of the roles of the varied consumers in kelp forests to understand the complexityofthefoodwebsinsuchanecosystem. Thetraditionalecologicalparadigm in regards to kelp bed food webs is the top down control by sea otters, which has been studied in great detail in Alaska. However, an experimental urchin removal study in the San Juan Channel showed that neither a monthly complete harvest of sea urchins (simulating sea otter predation), nor an annual size-selective harvest of sea urchins (simulating commercial urchin harvest), significantly increased the density of perennial or annual (incl. Nereocystis luetkeana) species of macroalgae after 2 years. These results suggest that other factors, such as grazing by other invertebrates, may play a large role in influencing community structure in the San Juan Channel. Invertebrate herbivores have been shown to play a crucial role in kelp bed destruction in N. luetkeana systems and it is known that crabs are important trophic links in kelp-dominated habitats and can influence food web dynamics by acting as consumers. I explored the potential role of Pugettia gracilis as kelp consumers using controlled choice and no-choice feeding experiments. I hypothesized that P. gracilis would show a feeding preference for N. luetkeana over two other local abundant kelp species. I performed my feeding trials with ten P. gracilis individuals, and three kelp species: Alaria marginata, Nereocystis luetkeana, and Saccharina latissima. The results of my trials showed that P. gracilis shows a feeding preference for N. luetkeana over A. marginata and S. latissima. These results show that despite the small size of P. gracilis, in dense population abundances it may be an important part of current trophic dynamics 2 and population changes of N. luetkeana forests in the San Juan Islands and elsewhere in the Salish Sea.","4200":"The rapid rise in anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and the subsequent acidification of the world oceans has increased the need to determine if these changes will seriously and adversely impact the microbial food web and its constituents. A mesocosm study was conducted to test the effects of elevated partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) on the community composition and abundance of bacterioplankton. Three levels of pCO2 were established in triplicate: 650 \u0152\u00baatm (Control), 1250 \u0152\u00baatm (High), and 1250 \u0152\u00baatm allowed to drift (Drift). Initial light levels were reduced to slow biological processes and were returned to ambient conditions on T10. Results of bacterial abundance were statistically significant between treatments with the High and Drift treatments showing the lowest abundance. Community composition was shown to change temporally with distinct shifts in structure from T0 to T13 to T21. There was no change in community species composition among the treatments. Study indicates elevated levels of pCO2 suppresses abundance of bacterioplankton without a corresponding change in community structure.","4201":"Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) are abiotically formed aggregates within the water column from physiological stress causing polysaccharides to be exuded by phytoplankton and some bacteria. They are considered a possible mechanism for carbon export from surface waters due to their high stickiness and thus ability to cause large aggregates to form. Ocean acidification is a process which may greatly influence the production and cycling of TEP within the water column. The San Juan Islands experience both anthropogenic and natural acidification of their surrounding waters. The influence of ocean acidification on TEP production within Friday Harbor waters has not yet been studied. To study TEP production under ocean acidification nine mesocosms with three treatments were utilized. Though no difference between the control and high treatments were found, possible evidence was seen for CO2 effecting TEP production; The drift treatment was significant different from the maintained high and control treatments, suggesting repetitive addition of CO2 to the environment does have an effect on TEP production within the mesocosms.","4202":"Diatoms contribute significantly to the transfer of dissolved organic carbon from the surface ocean to the deep in a system called the biological pump. Understanding how diatoms silicify (incorporate silica into their cell wall) in response to high partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) seawater is important to understand how ocean acidification will affect this biological pump. A mesocosm experiment was performed at University of Washington\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Friday Harbor Laboratories to investigate these effects. Three pCO2 treatments were used in triplicate to determine whether or not diatom silicification is directly affected by ocean acidification. The control and high treatment, at 650ppm and 1250ppm, were held at constant pCO2 levels with additions of highly saturated CO2 seawater. The drift treatment started at 1250ppm and was allowed to drift as biological processes used the CO2. Biogenic silica was measured every other day and integrated with diatom cell counts to calculate silicification. Results showed no differences between pCO2 treatments for total silica in a population and silicification per diatom cell. A variety of potential stressors were explored to understand the changes in diatom silicification throughout the experiment. Factors other than CO2, such as light limitation, are more likely to explain data trends. Further research is necessary to see how CO2 will affect diatoms\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 ability to sequester carbon especially when coupled with temperature increases.","4203":"Deleterious effects of anthropogenic carbon dioxide are not yet fully understood at ecosystem or food web level. A large volume mesocosm experiment conducted in Friday Harbor, Washington aimed to research the effects of increased pCO2 levels (650 ppm maintained, 1250 ppm maintained, and 1250 ppm drift) on phytoplankton communities to better understand the future ocean acidifications conditions. Research was focused on effects of pCO2 treatments on phytoplankton densities, genera composition, and correlations between dominant genera and pCO2 treatments. Phytoplankton densities were analyzed for three treatments of pCO2 over a 22-day experiment. No significant difference was found in phytoplankton densities among treatments or genus composition due to variability within treatments. However, it was found that a distinct phytoplankton community shift occurred in all treatments during the experiment due to natural variations in the ecosystem.","4204":"The transport system of cheilostome bryozoans is unusual among long-distance transport systems. In these colonial animals, a network of strands (the funicular system) carries nutrients to non-feeding individuals and to the growing edge of the colony. However a complex of cells appears to plug the pores that connect individuals. Focusing on the cheilostome, Membranipora membranacea, we used time lapse movies to test whether there were contractions\/dilations of funicular strands, as expected if muscular pumping were to move material through the strands, and to test whether cells or large vesicles moved directionally along the strands, potentially carrying nutrients. Neither contractions\/dilations of the funicular strands, nor persistent movement of particles or other features along the strands, were visible in time lapse videos (10 to 120 min at 4 to 10 sec per frame). The only visible movements were rare back-and-forth movements along the strands, or shaking of the strands. We injected materials that differed in molecular\/particle size to investigate the specificity of transport at pore plates. Both fluorescein (367 Da; as sodium salt) and fluorescein-dextran (70,000 Da) moved between individuals; however 2.0\u0152\u00bam fluorescent polystyrene beads did not. The fact that both fluorescein and fluorescein-dextran were transported suggests that transmembrane channel or transporter proteins are not required for transport; however there may be an upper size limit (&lt;2\u0152\u00bam) caused by something other than the pore itself. Our results are consistent with some transport mechanisms (e.g. paracellular diffusion or transcytosis at the pore plate) but inconsistent with others (muscularly-pumped flow along funicular strands, cell crawling, or transmembrane transport via transporter or channel proteins).","4205":"Seagrasses are facing a global population decline and bottom cover has grown sparser in many locations. Garrison Bay, in the San Juan Archipelago, was the site of a complete loss of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in 2003, and no recovery has occurred. Although the exact cause of the disappearance is unknown, one possible factor is nitrate loading caused by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). This study was divided into two parts in order to investigate the causative factors behind the disappearance. First a field component focused on identifying SGD sites and determining the concentration of nitrate in the discharge. Second, in a mesocosm study Z. marina was exposed to ambient, 2X ambient, or 5X ambient concentrations of nitrate. Three SGD sites were identified, with the site in a highly modified area (the site of a hotel and marina established in 1886) containing elevated levels of nitrate. Eelgrass grown in mesocosms was exposed to increased nitrate concentrations (2X and 5X) introduced into the water column. Although shoot growth differences were not significant, there was a significant difference in the total number of lesions, associated with the marine pathogen Labyrinthula zosterae, found in each treatment with the fewest lesions in the 5X ambient nitrate concentration and 180% more lesios in the 2X ambient nitrate concentration. This finding may indicate that while growth differences between treatments were not statistically significant, the 5X nitrate treatment may have decreseased the spread of Labyrinthula zosterae along shoots.","4206":"A variety of species are known to sense and respond to the geomagnetic field for navigation. The sea slug Tritonia tetraquetra (a.k.a. Tritonia diomedea) has been shown to respond to the magnetic field through both behavior and electrophysiological experiments. However, it remains unclear by which mechanism this sensory information is integrated into motor commands. Additionally, the purpose for a response to magnetic stimuli has yet to be determined. While it is hypothesized that the sea slug sometimes uses a cue-switching mechanism to navigate, ultimately relying on the magnetic field for orientation, laboratory experiments thus far have failed to demonstrate this behavior. The experiments here sought to test this cue-switching hypothesis by demonstrating a response to a local distortion in the geomagnetic field. However, the behavioral response observed was an increased turning frequency upon loss of an initial attractive odor, independent of magnetic distortion, which is inconsistent with the hypothesized straight, geomagnetic-guided crawling. Additionally, in electrophysiological experiments ciliary motor neurons Pd5 and Pd6, as well as sensory nerve CeN1, failed to demonstrate a response to rotations of the magnetic field, despite previous evidence that these units are involved in T. tetraquetra\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s magnetic response. These results, when compared with previously demonstrated responses, may imply conditional parameters under which detection and use of the magnetic field are employed, or may be due to population differences.","4207":"Suction feeding is the most common vertebrate feeding mode. Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 length3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 muscle cross-sectional area \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 length2). Since suction volume increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Two ways to counteract this deficit are to increase muscle mass or increase skeletal leverage within the jaw. In this study, we examined musculoskeletal variation in anatomy and kinematics across an ontogenetic series in the suction-feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Our results show that great sculpin mandibles change shape as they grow, increasing jaw-closing muscle leverage, which counters the force deficit (N = 6, p = 0.0456). Kinematic results agree: a given amount of muscle strain produces less jaw displacement in larger fish (N = 6, p &gt; 0.00015). We did not find disproportionate changes in muscle mass with size (N = 7, p=.514). Smaller fish, therefore, rely on high-velocity jaw closing whereas larger fish rely more on high forces to close the jaw. We hypothesize that a smaller fish needs high speed to reduce the risk of prey escape from a small suction volume, whereas a large fish needs high forces to move the disproportionately large volume of water.","4208":"Particle size distribution is a key physical factor in determining where organisms live in sedimentary marine habitats because it strongly influences the mechanical properties of the medium and thus the energy required to move through it. We examined burying efficiency in and preference among five natural sediments for two crab species \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Metacarcinus magister (the Dungeness crab), a habitat specialist and Cancer productus (the red rock crab), a habitat generalist. Crab burial speeds and sediment stiffnesses were measured at five field sites. Dungeness crabs buried equally well in less stiff, well-sorted sands and more stiff, poorly-sorted mud\/cobble mixtures. At all sites they buried more quickly than red rock crabs whose performance decreased with increasing heterogeneity of the sediment. These results are contrary to expectations based on reported habitat specificity of the two species. Burial speed decreased with increasing carapace size especially for red rock crabs. The burial success and speed of Dungeness crabs is associated with the relatively larger surface area of their propoduses and the sharper angle formed by the posterior border of the carapace and abdomen. In replicate mesocosms, crabs explored five substrates and then buried in one. Dungeness crabs tended to select well-sorted sediments similar to where we found them in the field. In contrast, red rock crabs were least likely to bury in the mud\/cobble sediment in which they had the most difficulty burying although this sediment was typical of the field site where they were most common. The discrepancies among burial performance, sediment preference, and natural distribution reveal the complexity of habitat use between these co-occurring species and are in contrast to the pattern shown by burying fish and some other crab species.","4209":"By studying variation in feeding apparatus morphology across similar sympatric species, we can better understand the evolutionary relationships and ecological niches of these species. The most common feeding technique among vertebrates is suction feeding, in which an animal rapidly expands its buccal cavity to create negative pressure and suck in prey. Suction feeders not only open their jaws quickly; they must also close them rapidly to prevent elusive prey from escaping. In this study, we compared jaw morphology and feeding kinematics of five species of Salish Sea sculpin. We used anatomical dissection to measure differences in jaw adductor morphology and jaw leverage, and we used Sonometric crystal implantation to measure gape change and muscle strain during feeding. Although we found high conservation of body length to muscle mass ratio among species, visual inspection of the head and jaw revealed important differences. We found that the red Irish lord (Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus) possessed the fastest jaw, as demonstrated by anatomical measurement of a small lever ratio, kinematic measurement of a large gape-change to muscle-strain ratio, and behavioral observation of the red Irish lord\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ambush hunting strategy. This study highlights the importance of including behavior and ecology in analyses of organismal morphology.","4210":"Understanding recent eelgrass declines in San Juan County is of vital importance, as these eelgrass communities represent incredible ecological and economic value. The alarming magnitude of these losses and the unlikelihood of natural recolonization are additional reasons to continue exploring factors that may have contributed to decline. This project addressed one of the least studied vehicles for coastal pollution as a potential contributor to eelgrass loss: submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). SGD can introduce potent pollutants such as nutrients and herbicides directly to nearshore ecosystems. The goal of this project was to determine whether SGD is affecting eelgrass health in San Juan Island National Historical Park sites by adding excess nitrogen or phosphorous to waters at these sites. While no phosphate loading was detected, elevated nitrogen concentrations were observed both in seawater samples, at approximately 1 mg\/L, as well as in SGD samples at 1-2 mg\/L nitrogen. Roche Harbor, on the north side of the island showed the highest concentrations at 2.1 mg\/L. Considering the harmful effects of nitrogen loading on eelgrass, it seems that SGD may have a negative effect on local eelgrass habitats.","4211":"Sexual selection involves a complex interplay between intrasexual selection and intersexual selection in which choice and competition converge to maximize reproductive fitness. Our study examines these selective forces in the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, an earwig species in which both females and males possess weaponry. Forceps asymmetry has been noted as a competitive advantage in size-matched small male maritime earwigs and was examined as a factor determining sexual selection along with body size. We examined the roles of these two factors, body size and forceps asymmetry, as it relates to four types of sexual selection; female choice, male choice, male competition, and female competition. We limited the movement of certain earwigs while allowing others to move freely within artificial arenas to examine choice and competition. Our results revealed strong sexual selection for larger sizes through both competition and choice, but there was no preference based on forceps asymmetry. We found significant results in all four trial types, including not only the more traditional male competition and female choice, but also female competition and male choice. However, competition trials yielded our most compelling results. This complex, multidimensional mating system is likely driven by competitive forces and highly influenced by factors determining dominance in intraspecific competition.","4212":"The Northern Clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus, has many well-studied morphological adaptations to help it cope with the harsh environment that it lives in: the intertidal zone. Lab studies have shown that this fish can adhere to smooth and rough surfaces as well as slippery and non-slippery surfaces. Now, the aim of the current study is to define the habitat of the Northern Clingfish and compare habitat parameters with these previous lab studies. We show that the clingfish is presented with a challenging, slippery habitat We find that nearly 90% of the rocks present in the habitat of the clingfish are covered in biofilm and are consequently slippery. Clingfish cope with their habitat by seeking shelter under rocks within a specific size range (15-45 cm in width) and they are most commonly found under rocks that have gravel as the main substrate. Rocks that clingfish were found under possessed a wide range of aufwuchs (periphyton) cover. Rock size did not correlate to fish length, but a bimodal distribution was found in the transect area.","4213":"The literature on paleontology and functional morphology both include many studies on the feeding mechanics of organisms. In extinct organisms, physiological data must be inferred from bone structure, or muscles scars, even in the most exceptionally preserved specimens (Benton, 2010). However even reconstruction and analysis of muscle scars in fossils rely heavily on assumptions (Rieppel, 2002). Given the resilient nature of enamel, teeth are often the most commonly found remains of extinct organisms, and in some cases they are only known remains (Adnet et al., 2009; Pol, 2012). Enamel is highly calcified and so, unlike other softer portions of an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anatomy, is readily preserved (Lucas et al., 2008). Fortunately, there is a close relationship between tooth form and function, which allows researchers to infer the ecology of the extinct organisms. Slender, pointed teeth, are ideal for puncturing, and bladed teeth are best suited for tearing and cutting prey, whereas more rounded and blunt teeth are thought to function better in crushing prey (Massare, 1987), a feeding strategy termed durophagy. Durophagous predators typically have robust jaw bones in addition to their distinctive and molariform teeth on the premaxilla, maxilla, dentary or the pharyngeal (Norton, 1988, Wilga and Motta, 2000). It is thought that this molariform tooth morphology, as well as tooth arrangement, may serve to increase tooth surface area, thus reducing the stress applied to teeth (Ramsay and Wilga, 2007) when crushing. Studies on the functional ability and structure of durophagous teeth have focused on a range of both extinct and extant organisms, including borophagines canids, early hominoids, and elasmobranchs (Lee et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2008; Tseng ZJ and Wang X, 2010). For these groups, tooth form dictates diet and, by extension, habitat selection and population ecology. From there it is possible to study large-scale evolutionary patterns, co-evolutions, and trophic interactions (Lauten 2013).","4214":"Climate Change affects the physical conditions of many environments. Increased temperature causes ice extent to decrease worldwide (IPCC, 2013). Glacier runoff during the spring and summer months increases the amount of freshwater pouring into the ocean creating salinity fluctuations. Surface salinity in the ocean can drop from~30ppt to ~21ppt. These fluctuations affect many marine organisms such as the sea star Pisaster ochraceus that cannot osmoregulate. P. orchraceus produces planktotrophic larvae that will also endure the fluctuations of salinity. The present study investigated whether differences in occurrence and intensity of salinity fluctuations at two locations in the Pacific Northwest cause sea stars to produce eggs and larvae with different protein profiles. Eggs and larvae from Snug Harbor with less influx of fresh water from the Fraser River and Cantilever Point with more, were exposed in the laboratory to two and four salinity fluctuations respectively during their development. Low salinity varied between 20 and 22 ppt and high salinity between 30 and 32 ppt. The length, width, and stomach width were noted and protein profiles obtained for larvae in control and fluctuating salinity treatments. Significant differences were observed between treatments for larvae from Snug Harbor, a site less influenced by the Fraser River. Larvae in the controls were significantly bigger than those reared in fluctuating salinity. No significant differences in larval size were observed for larvae from Cantilever Point, a site that experiences a significant influx of low salinity waters from the Fraser River several times during the summer months. Greater expression of a high molecular weight protein (&gt;300kDa) was observed for eggs produced by females from Cantilever Point than for eggs produced by females from Snug Harbor. Larvae from both locations expressed this high molecular weight protein. Larvae from the two locations differed in mid-range to low molecular weight proteins. The High molecular weight proteins might be a kind of ATPase pump, while the low to intermediate size proteins might be used for cell signaling or heat shock proteins that will help protein folding during stressful events of low salinity","4215":"In a dynamic environment such as the rocky marine intertidal zone, the stresses experienced by epibionts and their hosts may differ when these animals are engaged in symbioses compared with when they are attached alone to the surrounding rock. We compared the species composition of the epibiotic community on gastropod shells to that of colonizers on neighboring rock surfaces to determine whether intertidal zone, wave action, or basibiont identity affected the epibionts present. We examined two tidal heights (a lower Saccharina sessilis zone and a higher Fucus gardneri\/Semibalanus cariosus zone) at three sites of varying wave exposure (Westside Preserve, Cattle Point, and Colin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Cove) on San Juan Island, WA. In the lower tidal zone (but not in the higher), the percent of unfouled snails was much greater than predicted based on the surrounding substratum. Fewer than four algal species dominated the substratum at both tidal heights, but the identity of the dominant algae differed between tidal heights and did not match the dominant epibiotic species. Instead, small individuals of the barnacles Semibalanus cariosus and Balanus glandula, spirorbid worms, an excavating alga, an excavating sponge, and diatoms were the most prevalent epibionts. While the basibiotic gastropods were less fouled than we expected overall, we found heavily-fouled individuals (especially limpets) interspersed among unfouled individuals. We deployed cleaned empty shells, either sanded (\u201a\u00c4\u00faweathered\u201a\u00c4\u00f9) or intact, of the gastropod species Tectura scutum, Lottia digitalis, Nucella canaliculata, and Nucella lamellosa for 3 to 6 weeks in the higher intertidal zone and subtidally at two sites. Differences in settlement of epibionts seemed more due to microhabitat effects than to shell morphology, but it is hard to generalize from such short-term settlement studies.","4216":"The earth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s oceans are becoming more acidic due to absorption of atmospheric CO2. Ocean acidification decreases the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater, and imposes increased energy costs on organisms that deposit calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Larval stages of these organisms are especially vulnerable to stresses of acidification and nutrition, which may have a common energetic basis. We investigated how acidification and nutrition affected pre-competent larval growth of the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata during the first 8 days after hatching. We also asked if a four-day period of food and\/or acidification stress, applied to older competent larvae, affected speed of metamorphosis and juvenile growth after stresses were relieved. Treatments in both experiments used all 4 combinations of pH 7.8 or 7.4, and high or low food concentration (15x104 or 1x104 cells\/ml Isochrysis galbana). Lower food level in the pH 7.8 treatments resulted in decreased growth rates for pre-competent larvae (p&lt;0.0001), while larvae failed to grow in the pH 7.4 treatments regardless of food level. Competent larvae were unaffected by either pH or nutrition level over the course of a four-day stress period indicated by their inability to grow. Increased acidification extended the latency of KCl-induced metamorphosis in the second experiment (p &lt; 0.0309), but nearly all larvae completed metamorphosis within 24 hours. Together, acidification and low food availability decreased subsequent juvenile growth in the first 6 days after metamorphosis (p&lt;0.01), demonstrating latent effects of larval experience.","4217":"Many marine gastropods face the challenge of adhering to substrates under adverse flow conditions. Some species live on both solid and sedimentary substrates, although how these substrate generalists resist detachment from materials with fundamentally different mechanical properties is not well studied. We used field observations and flow tank experiments to compare the capabilities and tactics of Haminoea vesicula, an opisthobranch gastropod, when exposed to destabilizing flow on its native sand and eelgrass. Velocities of outgoing and incoming spring tides in the tidal creeks and over and within eelgrass beds where H. vesicula live at False Bay, San Juan Island, WA ranged from 1 to 30 cm\/s. In a flow tank, snails\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 resistance to current depended on substrate and orientation. On eelgrass, snails moving into flow maintained their position at velocities exceeding 40 cm\/s, but were more vulnerable when facing away or sideways to flow (falling off at mean velocities of 25 and 32 cm\/s respectively). In the latter orientation, snails would often rotate into flow by hooking onto the leading edge of eelgrass with the anterior edge of the cephalic shield. In this position, snails resisted flows exceeding 40 cm\/s. Snails crawling on sediment and exposed to turbulent flow drew sediment-encrusted mucus sheets dorsally, completely ensheathing their bodies. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSheeting\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 significantly increased snails\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 effective weight and ability to resist flow. On sand, snails ensheathed in sediment were least stable in the sideways orientation compared to those facing into or away from flow (mean velocities of 13 vs. 20 and 23 cm\/s). Experiments on sandpaper indicated that snails were destabilized on sediment due to failure of adhesion of the sedimentary layers beneath them rather than their attachment to the sand.","4218":"Within the last 100 years, the arrival in the Pacific Northwest of the invasive European slug Airon rufus has introduced a potential competitor for the iconic banana slug Ariolimax columbianus, the second largest terrestrial slug in the world. We conducted transect studies in three habitats (cedar forest, Doug fir forest, and grasslands) on San Juan Island, WA, to examine the relative demographics of these slugs and note possible food sources. Utilizing those data, we conducted feeding preference studies across leaves from 16 local plant species, incorporating slugs from the two species from difference source habitats, difference size classes, and both the black and brown morphs of Arion rufus, which tend to specialize in different habitats. We used ImageJ to measure the area eaten from each leaf and calculated feeding rates. The feeding preferences of Ariolimax columbianus were consistent across size classes and source populations., and the two color morphs and various source populations of Arion rufus were also largely consistent within this species. While both species are generalists, they demonstrated feeding preferences the frequently overlapped, indicating that Ariolimax columbianus may compete with Arion rufus for food resources.","4219":"Diurnal exposure to air during fluctuating tides and forces imposed by rushing waves make the intertidal zone, the habitat of the Northern clingfish, uniquely difficult to survive in. The goals of this study were to answer (1) what are the relevant wave forces acting upon the fish on the San Juan Island and (2) how do changing water levels and thus daily time spent under water percentages (DTUW%) affect their distribution? Dynamometers were built and distributed at 3 locations on the San Juan Island to measure the maximum wave velocities. Results show that over all, wave velocities acting on the island do not exceed 4m\/s. Clingfish may have the ability to withstand higher velocities than those measured. A transect was set up at the Reuben Tarte (RT) beach and fish distribution was recorded during the lowest tides between June 30, 2014-July30, 2014. Water heights to reach MLLW were calculated at RT using the law of cosine and these values were later correlated to NOAA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s daily water levels to find DTUW%. Clingfish were found exclusively in areas that had at least 80 DTUW% which leads to the conclusion that water levels and thus DTUW% are important determinants in clingfish survival.","4220":"To prevent constant competition across species, different species may develop different morphologies to increase their ability to attain a certain food source within a niche. By dissecting the adductor muscle and taking measurements in four sculpin species we can begin to assess how their feeding styles and niches influence their jaw morphology. Many parts of the jaw, such as the mandible, grow with the individual size of the organism, contributing to an ability to consume bigger prey. The advantages of more bite force for crushing harder prey, such as in Enophrys bison, are compared to the advantages of higher velocity and fluid flow in the buccal cavity, such as in the suction using Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. We also found that bigger adductor muscles does not actually lead to larger gape angles, but in fact decreases the maximum gape angles.","4221":"Chitons, like other mollusks, rely upon a variety of adhesive forces to combat factors such as wave action and predation in the intertidal. In this study, we explore what effect suction has upon a chiton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total force of attachment and tenacity, as well the impact of substrate roughness. In this experiment, we found that suction plays a significant role in chiton attachment over a range of roughness. We also found that a chiton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s adhesive tenacity decreases significantly upon rougher textures.","4222":"The foraging behaviors and prey choice of intertidally foraging birds is largely undocumented. A series of four observations on prey choice was done at a discrete site during low tidal heights (&lt;.0.61 m) and high tidal heights (&gt;1.52m). Prey was defined as three distinct categories, \u201a\u00c4\u00faFish\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, \u201a\u00c4\u00faCrustacean\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faOther\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. There were significantly more crustaceans consumed than fish or other organisms. No observed feeding during high tidal heights. Conspicuous consistent behaviors also noted but not formally analyzed. There is potential for intertidally foraging birds to have top-down control of intertidal ecosystems.","4223":"The overabundance of one species in a particular area is typically bolstered by a biotic or abiotic factor that allows them to outcompete other species for space and resources. The undersides of the docks in the town of Friday Harbor and at the Friday Harbor Laboratories are overrun with white plumose anemones, Metridium farcimen. The sewage output in the town docks contains particulate matter, which the prey of M. farcimen may feed on. To determine if particulate matter contributes to M. farcimen abundance, I collected specimens from both locations, placed them in controlled tanks and exposed them to separated samples of zooplankton of varying sizes. The anemone did not show an overall preference for food particle size, although they did show a slight preference of 0.3 mm particles over 0.5 mm particles. It is possible that they are consuming all size classes of zooplankton that feed on sewage particulates.","4224":"The marine intertidal is an area prone to high wave energy and flow velocities, and the organisms living there are subjected to large hydrodynamic forces, such as drag. These forces acting to dislodge organisms may result in reduced foraging efficiency and depressed overall growth. In this study the body shape of a snail, chiton, and limpet are subjected to flume testing to observe how drag forces and drag coefficients change with a range of Reynolds numbers simulating currents up to 6 m\/s. In higher flow velocities the snail body shape experienced drastically higher drag forces than the limpet and chiton body shape. The drag coefficients for the limpet and chiton both were relatively high at low flow velocity, and quickly decreased at higher speeds. The snail however experienced an opposite change in drag coefficient, with a lower drag coefficient at low flow speeds and increased with higher flow speeds. When compared to Reynolds number drag coefficients for the limpet and chiton show little change at higher Reynolds number, contrast to the snail body shape in which the drag coefficient appears to fluctuate with increasing Reynolds number.","4225":"This paper looks at the forces involved in the attachment of M. farcimen to substrate. Many sessile and transitory, aquatic animals rely on the secretion of an adhesive glue for attachment to substrate, like most sea anemones. However, other attachment mechanisms exist. For example, limpets and clingfish rely on suction. The pull off forces of M. farcimen attached to substrate were tested, and then used to calculate tenacity. Two groups were compared. One group was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass with 1.5mm holes drilled throughout, and the other was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass without any holes. Tenacity calculations revealed that specimens were more strongly attached to the acrylic glass without holes, suggesting that suction is involved in M. farcimen attachment to substrate. Attachment site selection was also explored. When M. farcimen were given the choice between substrates with holes and substrates without holes, there was no significant difference in the frequency of selection for attachment.","4226":"Docks in the Friday Harbor Island have been observed to have many nudibranchs present on them. One hypothesis for this is the creosote, a chemical used to help preserve the wood from wear, is attracting them to the pilings. Creosote has been shown to have negative effects on the environment, and because nudibranchs\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 rinophores are sensitive chemoreceptors that are used to help find food, navigate, and find mates, an interaction could be harmful to these animals. Our study looked at the preference of location in a tank with one side having creosote-treated wood and one side having non-treated wood samples. We used Triopha catalinae (Clown Dorid) and Archidoris montereyensis (Sea Lemon) as our two species. We found there was no significant preference to creosote. We also saw no preference to creosote during the day or evening, but saw a trend in T. catalinae to prefer the sides of the tank especially during the afternoon runs. There was also a trend to avoid the drain in the tank for both species. Nudibranchs therefore show no attraction to creosote in their environment.","4227":"Food acquisition is a necessary component of survival for any organism and in order to feed effectively, a predator must meet the mechanical demands of its prey. This study\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s focus was to make general observations and conclusions about the evolution and adaptation of several morphological traits of pacific salmon jaws based on varied feeding behaviors. Dissections of juvenile king, adult king, and keta salmon were performed, during which measurements pertaining to the articular joint and adductor mandibulae were taken and recorded. The study found that king salmon have stronger adductor mandibulae, while keta have stronger skeletal jaw components. This trade-off is a morphological adaptation in which either force or velocity can be prioritized. Each species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 jaw anatomy is specialized for their diet and feeding habits, for example stronger jaws to accommodate the crushing of tough prey or fast jaw closure for hunting fish prey. Other conclusions, like the positive correlation between head length and adductor mandibulae mass, were also drawn from the study.","4228":"River dam removals are a form of sediment supply to the sub-tidal areas near river mouths. Suspended sediment in the sub-tidal water column can attenuate light, decreasing the amount of light available to seabed photosynthesizers, but not much is known about the effects of sediment plume light attenuation on kelp growth. During a recent dam removal project on the Elwha River, kelp densities in the sub-tidal region declined. In this study we evaluate trends in kelp growth since dam removal on the Elwha River began, using dive surveys from 2010 to 2013, and relate these trends to long-term river turbidity and light intensity data obtained during a 3-day study period in April 2014. The results suggest that the river plume attenuates light and has been at least partially responsible for decreases in kelp densities, but that this is not the sole determining factor in kelp growth. Another factor hypothesized to influence kelp growth is a difference in substrate size on either side of the river mouth.","4229":"The Elwha River on Washington State\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Olympic Peninsula was home to two dams for almost a century. Dam removal began in 2011, releasing sediment into the Elwha River, forming a pronounced river plume. It is important to evaluate the response of the river ecosystem to such a drastic change. We examined light attenuation associated with the plume, using photosynthetically-active radiation measurements along with suspended sediment concentrations. Results suggest that there is not enough light penetrating depths of 5 m for successful primary production of some species. Suspended sediment in the water column prohibits light penetration &gt; 10% water depth. As a result, the habitat of Z. marina, a local sea-grass species requiring a minimum of 18.6% light penetration, is likely affected. Based on suspended sediment concentrations in the water and the available light, it is hypothesized that Z. marina needs to grow at shallower depths away from the river plume in order to receive sufficient light in the Elwha delta.","4230":"River plumes are a form of sediment transport from the river to the sea. In the Elwha River, Washington, suspended sediment forms a river plume that is released into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Here, we evaluate the suspended-sediment concentration in water-column profiles and sensor calibration to determine the location of the plume in the Strait. The results suggest that in general, suspended-sediment concentrations were higher on the west side of the delta than to the east side, and a bottom plume was observed in the east. Based on changes in salinity and tides, we suggest that tides control the movement of suspended sediment in the vicinity of the Elwha River mouth, and that low salinity and suspended-sediment concentration are correlated.","4231":"Small mountainous rivers, such as the Elwha River in Washington State, play a key role in the sedimentary processes that form and maintain the structure and function of their neighboring shorelines. The Elwha River was dammed from 1910 to 2011, and construction of the dams has been attributed to coarsening and erosion of its delta and adjacent shorelines. In turn, the habitat made available to marine organisms was altered for nearly 100 years. This study examined the median (D50) of the grain sizes, sand fractions, and respective elevations of physical samples from the Elwha delta using dry and wet sieve methods, as well as average surface grain sizes using photographic methods, to evaluate the impacts of dam removal of the restoration and\/or expansion of Pacific sand lance (sand lance) spawning habitat. Of the 34 physical samples collected and as of 12 and 13 April 2014, the findings suggest 10 sample locations west and 8 samples locations east of the river mouth met the three parameters documented as preferred sand lance spawning habitat. Each of the 18 locations within the study area had grain-size distributions with medians ranging between ~0.2 and 2.0 mm, the bulk sand fractions of each sample ranged between ~60 and 98%, and their respective elevations were between +1.33 and +2.22 m MLLW. Potentially suitable spawning habitat for sand lance was found ~1,230 m west and ~1,500 m east of the river mouth.","4232":"Dam construction on rivers like the Elwha River in Washington State reduces sediment supply to adjacent coastal systems and has often been linked to coastal erosion and threats to human infrastructure. With the removal of two dams on the Elwha River, it was hypothesized that chronic erosion of the surrounding coastline would slow or reverse. To test the impact of dam placement and removal on shoreline change, shoreline change was quantified by digitizing shoreline position using a 1908 survey map and four aerial photographs spanning 1939-2014. Anthropogenic and natural features related to shoreline change were identified using a combination of aerial photographs, remotely-sensed data and field surveys. Shoreline change analysis revealed retreat of the vegetation line east of the river mouth both before and during dam removal and areas of net accretion to the west. However, for ~1 km east of the river mouth during dam removal, new sediment accreted along the shoreline where vegetation retreated. Although this indicates that in some places movement of the vegetation line is not a reliable proxy for shoreline change, it also reveals that dam removal has not slowed erosion in all areas of the eastern coastline. Local wave regimes and the locations of abandoned river channels, levees, and shoreline armoring correlate spatially with calculated patterns of shoreline change. This suggests the importance of considering all of the potential geologic and anthropogenic influences when predicting shoreline responses to major disturbances such as dam removal.","4233":"Dam removals induce large scale disturbances to a system, having wide-spread impacts on the physical and biological characteristics of the rivers and coastal waters downstream. Removal of two large dams on the Elwha River, Washingtion has resulted in increases in sediment delivery to the Elwha delta affecting substrate composition and biological communities. Pre-dam removal monitoring has characterized substrate and community composition but uncertainties on the extent of deposition and resulting community responses to increased deposition remain. The relationship between acoustic backscatter of the seabed, seafloor substrate, and macrofaunal habitat was examined using sidescan sonar data and physical grab samples taken on the Elwha delta. Backscatter intensity analysis was combined with grain-size distribution allowing for classification of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2suitable\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 versus \u201a\u00c4\u00f2probably suitable\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 habitat. Habitat suitability pre and post dam removal was determined based on shifts in substrate on the subaqueous delta following dam removal. Acoustic backscatter results suggest an increase in fine-grain sediment, increasing the area of unsuitable habitat by 0.7 km2 since pre-dam removal conditions. Physical grab samples taken pre-dam removal reveal seafloor substrate was composed of primarily of gravel and sand, whereas post-dam removal conditions to date were characterized by sand and mud. Grain-size analysis from 2014 suggests a continuation of the shift toward fine-grained sediment. In the short-term it appears sediment supply in post-dam removal conditions is high enough to support the accumulation of mud on the delta, modifying the seafloor substrate and likely resulting in loss of kelp habitat. Whether these trends persist and kelp is permanently displaced remains unknown.","4234":"For almost 100 years sediment has been building up behind two dams on the Elwha River in Washington State (Warrick et al., 2009). It was determined that in order to restore the watershed, the most effective process would be the removal of the dams (Gelfenbaum et al., 2009). This study looks at the effects of the increased sediment budget on comparative grain-size and topographical and bathymetry profiles of two transect lines, east and west of the Elwha River mouth. We found a higher accumulation of sediment on the East transect versus the West transect which is likely due to the oblique wave angle on the delta and net alongshore transport to the east. The morphology of the East transect line after dam removal changed to a steeper slope which could be caused from the increased sediment being deposited faster than it can be eroded. Lastly, we found that the beach substrate within the troughs on the subaerial delta was finer while the berms consisted of coarser material, which is likely due to the relative exposure to wave energy.","4235":"Dam removal is an emerging technique for ecosystem management. Reservoirs behind the dams are known to be both carbon sinks and sources. The Elwha dam removals in Washington State are the largest dam removals in U.S. history. In this study the fate of the carbon stored in the reservoirs upon its abrupt release is evaluated. Sediment samples from the estuary, delta and water column were tested for their particulate organic carbon content through loss-on-ignition testing. Grain sizes of sediment samples were analyzed and volume estimates of carbon deposits were calculated. The results indicated that particulate organic carbon was preferentially deposited in two locations. The large woody debris typically settled on the subaerial delta, while the carbon sorbed to silt and clay settled in the estuary and subaqueous delta. The sudden release of the reservoirs resulted in a condition where river meandering through the former reservoir beds is minimal. As a result, approximately half of the carbon likely sorbed to the sediment in the reservoirs remains. The rapid sediment accumulation resulted in a higher-than-average carbon burial rate of the roughly 165,000 +\/- 124,000 tonnes of carbon deposited on the delta. This suggests dam removal can not only restore an ecosystem and may also be able to help mitigate climate change.","4236":"Lontra canadensis, the river otter, is a predator in marine nearshore ecosystems in North America. Because it is a top carnivore, L. canadensis, may be exerting a trophic cascade. Its diet can vary regionally and possibly seasonally. This study examines the diet of L. canadensis through feces analysis from two sites on San Juan Island, WA. Fishes and crustaceans were found to be the main prey items, and there was evidence that relative proportions of different prey types differ with location.","4237":"Primary productivity does not occur in deeper waters due to limiting light availability, and thus deep subtidal organisms receive energy in the form of detritus. Urchins in the San Juan Archipelago catch and consume large quantities of kelp detritus, and due to inefficient digestive systems their feces have high caloric value and are readily available to benthic organisms. The nutritional value of fresh Nereocystis luetkeana and Saccharina latissima were compared to that of feces from urchins fed the same algal species in a set of population growth and dietary preference experiments using the copepod species Tigriopus californicus. Population growth rates were not recorded due to massive mortalities; however, significant copepod preference for urchin feces over both algal species was observed. This suggests urchins may provide a substantial link between shallow habitats of high algal productivity and deeper subtidal environments of low productivity by providing detritus in the form of high nutrient fecal matter.","4238":"Algal subsidies are extremely important to the success of the deep benthos where there is little to no primary productivity. Little research has been done on the nutritional value of detritus, such as pieces of kelp, sinking into deep habitats. Sea urchin feces, in the form of detritus, may provide an energetic link to benthic communities with no primary productivity. Urchins are known to have an inefficient digestive system which leaves the potential for high food value in feces. I conducted a series of tests on the relative caloric contents of algae and urchin feces. First, I measured the biomass consumed and egested by urchins. Secondly, I quantified the caloric content of aged and fresh feces of 10 urchins fed diets of either Nereocystis luetkeana or Saccharina latissima. For both kelp diets, the caloric content of algal material increased after being consumed by urchins, and the longer the urchin feces aged, the higher the caloric value became. This could be significant in considering the importance of urchins as a link to benthic communities that rely heavily on detritus for their success.","4239":"Mussels are filter feeders living and thriving in the harsh conditions of the intertidal environment. Many factors attribute to their success including aggregating in groups, hard shells, but more specifically their ability to strongly attach themselves to substrate with byssal threads. Byssus is a proteinaceous fiber excreted by the byssal foot of a mussel for attachment. It is important to understand the energy distribution Mytilus trossulus, by investigating the energetic cost of byssus production. In this study we manipulate M. trossulus into producing different amounts of byssus among three treatments over a thirty-day experiment. Three byssal removal regiments: those cut daily, those cut weekly, and those never cut, were measured and analyzed for comparisons in metric growth. The mussels with byssal threads being cut daily showed the lowest percent increases in shell length, height, width, and weight among the three treatment groups.","4240":"Beach ecosystems rely on the supply of off-site primary production in the form of stranded algae, or beach wrack. As beach wrack washes up on shore, it is colonized by a host of microbes, detrivores and herbivores, which supply the beach ecosystem food web. This study seeks to understand how nutrients are transferred from seaweed throughout the food web by looking at how mass loss changes in beach wrack as larger invertebrates are included or excluded from the system. We found more total colonizers of beach wrack in treatments that included larger invertebrates. The community structure of colonizers shifted with site, and in treatments that included large amphipods there was more mass loss of algae due to herbivory. In wrack with more ephydridae larvae, mass loss was more uniform between treatments. This shows that the community dynamics of beach wrack colonizers affect how it is degraded, and that the presence of large herbivores like amphipods contributes to the degradation of wrack and thus its integration into the beach ecosystem food web.","4241":"This study analyzes the diets of Lontra canadensis populations on San Juan Island, Washington. It tests the hypothesis that the majority of river otter diets, in the populations studied, is composed of fish and crustacean species. Sixty scat samples were collected from two latrine sites in differing environments, and sorted through for remaining hard prey fragments. Fish and crustaceans were the overwhelming majority of otter prey found at each site. However, crustaceans made up a greater proportion of the diets of L. canadensis foraging in the sheltered harbor site than those hunting at the wave-exposed point. This study acts as a starting point for future river otter diet analysis in the San Juan Archipelago, an area not previously studied.","4242":"Light plays an important role in kelp ecology as an energy source and as an important kelp growth regulator. It induces a negative phototropic response in kelp haptera. Because longer wavelengths of light are available at shallower depths in additions to shorter wavelengths, it was hypothesized that kelp species generally inhabiting shallower water (e.g., Alaria marginata) would have a phototropic response to red (720-740 nm), green (520-540 nm), and blue (420-440 nm) light. Species generally inhabiting deeper water (e.g., Agarum fimbriatum) would have a stronger negative phototropic response in the blue wavelength of the light in comparison to A. marginata and other color treatments. Kelp haptera were isolated and exposed to unidirectional red, green, and blue light for 16 days. Controls were exposed to unidirectional sunlight or no light. The hypothesis was mostly confirmed. The blue light exposure showed the highest phototropic response in both species, but a higher relative response in A. fimbriatum. Alaria marginata haptera responded to all wavelengths of light. Green exposure produced the lowest response in all species Moreover, it was discovered that red light was responsible for greater growth of haptera in A. marginata than other treatments colors. The mechanism and ecological implications of red light-driven hapteral growth are opportunities for further research.","4243":"This study investigates sea star wasting disease seen in ecologically important predatory sea stars on intertidal coasts of San Juan Island, Lopez Island and Orcas Island (Washington, United States). Three experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of diet, temperature, salinity on the vulnerability of sea stars to wasting disease. To test the hypothesis that higher pathogen-dosed food would result in heightened infection intensities and also different diet types would result in different infection intensities, we fed Pycnopodia helianthoides with healthy and pathogen-dosed clams and mussels separately. There is no significant difference in either different diet types or in different pathogen-dosed levels treatments to the prevalence of sea star wasting disease. To test the hypothesis that temperature influences the prevalence of sea star wasting disease, we kept P. helianthoides in normal temperature tanks and higher temperature tanks. The prevalence of sea star wasting disease was always higher in warmer temperature treatments. To test the hypothesis that lower salinity environment would lead to higher prevalence of sea star wasting disease, we kept P. helianthoides under normal and lower salinity treatments. More symptomatic sea stars were found in the lower salinity experiment group. Furthermore, disease effects showed seasonal changes in field surveys. Compared with survey data from last winter, sea stars showed higher prevalence of disease in late spring.","4244":"This study explored the relationship that flow in Nereocystis luetkeana beds has to zooplankton communities in the San Juan Islands. The hypothesis was that current flow rates would decrease further inside a kelp bed and that this would affect the types and densities of zooplankton. More Calanoid copepods were expected outside of the beds and more larval organisms inside the beds. Flow rates were measured by attaching blocks that dissolve over time to kelp at the center, edge and outside the kelp bed and comparing the changes in weight. Zooplankton sampling was done with a water pump and net. Results were statistically inconclusive due to small sample size and difficulty in retrieving blocks. There were possible connections between the rate of flow and the differences in zooplankton communities in and out of kelp beds at different sites. Lower velocity sites appear to have more different communities in and out.","4245":"This study investigated Seastar Wasting Disease (SWD) in both Pycnopodia helianthoides and Pisaster ochraceus, involving field surveying, diet, temperature and salinity experiments. SWD describes a set of symptoms that has been seen in sea stars and it is most easily recognized by the presence of white lesions, tissue deterioration and eventually death. The pathogen and disease mechanism is still poorly understood and there have been scattered incidences of SWD reported for the last 50 years, however the current epizooitic has persisted for nearly a year, and has afflicted sea stars on over 3000 miles of coastline. Our study showed that increasing water temperature and decreasing salinity both independently correlate with increasing rates of symptoms appearing on Pycnopodia helianthoides. Field surveying of Pisaster displayed a strong correlation between temperature at the field site and percentage of sea stars showing lesions. Prevalence of SWD increases with seasonally warming temperatures and it is imperative to explore the mechanisms of this relationship and what ecological implications this entails.","4246":"Acellular bone in more derived fishes has been observed withstanding higher stain rates than cellular bones in mammals. The fracture energy of a material can be calculated using an impact test. The opercles the great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were dissected, cut into uniform sizes with a laser, and subjected to a Chapry Impact test. The cross sectional areas of broken samples were used to calculate the fracture energy of the material. The mean of the nobone trials was 0.8124 m with a standard deviation of 0.00176. . Maximum and minimum values for fracture energy of acellular bone were 2877.63 J\/cm2 and 1940.308 J\/cm2, respectively. Maximum and minimum values for fracture energy of cellular were 2643.25 J\/cm2 and 1663.49 J\/cm2, respectively. The fracture energies of the acellular and cellular bone were not significantly different (p=0.3483).","4247":"I investigated the affect of ontogeny on the structure and function of pre-\u00ac\u221e\u00ac\u00a9\u201a\u00c4\u00eaopercular spines. By measuring how these spines matched up against the standard length of the animal. Spines were surgically removed from Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus and put through puncture tests to measure the required force to puncture a ratio of the spine length. We found that spine length grows isometrically to standard length and force to puncture showed a negative allometry. Meaning that larger individuals had the same size spine to body length ratio but the larger spines is more efficient at puncturing. To assess the structure Finite Elemental Analysis techniques were applied to three different size classes of spines. This analysis showed that smaller spines concentrate the Von Mises stress at the tip while the largest sine dissipates this stress down the dorsal medial ridge. The smallest class of spine also showed a much higher Von Mises stress than the larger spine.","4248":"The family of the Agonidae is characterized by the presence of modified bony scales that form a protecting armor against predators. Despite some very intensive research concerning the skeletal cranial and postcranial anatomy of different Agonids, little information is available in the literature concerning the morphology of these bony scales. In this paper, three common species of the Northeastern Pacific Ocean are microscopically (both stereo and scanning electron microscopy) investigated to show that these bony plates are (a) morphologically different from regular fish scales, (ii) build for strength but also for minimizing the weight of the armor plates and (iii) morphologically different between different species.","4249":"Flatfishes (Actinopterygii: Pleuronectiformes) are a diverse group of teleost fishes, with over 700 species in the order. Jaw asymmetry and diet have been thought to contribute to flatfish diversity but this has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. Here I use geometric morphometric and comparative methods to test whether ocular-blind side asymmetry in flatfish head morphology contributed to flatfish diversification. I find that the repeated convergent evolution of similar morphology, jaw function, and diet likely contribute to the high diversity of flatfishes.","4250":"Many species of elongate fishes use Anguilliform swimming to propel themselves through the water (Gillis 1996, Long 1998). A fish using this method passes a wave of motion from the head, through the body, to the tail causing thrust. This type of swimming is the only one in which the entire body is used as opposed to just the caudal end such as in Thunniform swimmers (Tytell 2010). When watching certain species of elongate fishes swim, an interesting rotation in the body can be observed. If the fish is being looked at dorsally as it swims, there is a clear view of the lateral side of the fish as the tail beats back and forth. This view changes as the fish passes the wave from its head to its tail. The current work will describe a new method for measuring this rotation, or wobble, in the fish as it is swimming.","4251":"Shark\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ventilation has long been characterised by a two-pump model, where the water coming from the spiracle and the mouth is released by the gill slits after the breathing process. This movement is created by the difference of pressure between the oro-branchial cavity and the parabranchial cavity, consisting of five gill pouches. In an attempt to compare the actual flow velocity coming from each of these five gill openings, experiments have been made on seven individuals of spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi. External measurements have been taken, revealing important differences between the fifth gill slit and the four others, in term of vertical length and width. Also, the introduction of dyed water just above the spiracle has revealed the utilisation of the four first slits. A particle image velocimetry analysis have confirmed the weak flow coming from this last slit. It has also exposed the possibility of the fourth slit\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flow being less than the flow coming from the three first gill openings. This could be in relation with their feeding behavior, which mostly consist in suction action. The fifth slit could then be used to discharge water while the shark is feeding on preys.","4252":"Deep-sea fishes are known to have muscles that are higher in water content than their shallow-living relatives. In addition to this watery muscle, some deep-dwelling fishes also have a gelatinous layer either directly below the skin or around the spine. This study investigated the composition and implications of this mysterious gelatinous tissue in one of the planet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s deepest-living fishes. Gel tissues from eight deep water species were analyzed for water content, ionic composition, and osmolality. Bulk protein, lipid, and carbohydrate assays were also conducted. These analyses do not support the hypotheses that this tissue plays a role in nutrient storage or buoyancy. The gelatinous layer is most obvious in the hadal snailfish Notoliparis kermadecensis, making it an appropriate model organism to investigate gel function. The authors propose that the gelatinous tissue that surrounds the fish\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s muscle may act as an energetically inexpensive method of increasing swimming efficiency. To test this hypothesis, swimming performance in the gelatinous hadal snailfish was compared to swimming performance in the tidal snailfish, Liparis florae, which have similar morphology, but with no subcutaneous gel. Video analyses show that Liparis florae swam more body lengths per second than their hadal counterparts. A robotic snailfish model was also used to analyze the impacts of the gelatinous layer on locomotory performance. The robot swam trials with tails of varying water volume. The model showed higher swimming performance with a water-filled tail than with an empty one. Data from these three analyses suggest that the gelatinous layer may aid hadal snailfish locomotion.","4253":"Previous research has shown little effect of tooth shape on puncturing ability (Whitenack &amp; Motta, 2010), and though the concept of shark teeth as a saw blade has been explored, it has not been manifested beyond mathematical models and hypotheses (Frazzetta, 1988). Frazzetta\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s analysis covered many aspects of shark teeth in the context of sawing but lacks physical data of their effect when applied. Thus, this project set out to answer several questions about efficiency of shark teeth at sawing prey items: effect of tooth morphology on sawing efficiency, which varied strongly by species; sawing efficiency by trial, to test whether or not teeth are designed for a single use; and, in concept, to see if I can extrapolate feeding ecology from these factors.","4254":"Durophagous animals are equipped with myriad morphological adaptations for consuming durable prey. Convergent traits for processing hard prey generally include robust feeding musculature, cyclical loading patterns for crushing biological composites, reinforced skeletons, and an array of specialized tooth designs (Van Valkenburgh 1988; Summers, 2000; Summers et al., 2003; Huber et al., 2005). Molariform teeth are well-known in mammals, but cusped and even concave tooth shapes are present in durophagous taxa (Erickson et al. 2012; Crofts and Summers, 2014). In some durophagous stingrays (Family Myliobatidae), the teeth are fused, forming paired (upper and lower jaw) occlusal surfaces. Individual teeth interlock to form this tooth module. As in other elasmobranchs, teeth in these rays are conveyed anteriorly (or labially) as they wear and are eventually shed (Reif et al., 1978). These myliobatid stingrays include the eagle (Aetobatinae), bat (Myliobatinae), cownose (Rhinopterinae), and devil (Mobulinae) rays (Aschliman et al., 2012; Aschliman, 2014). These rays generally prey on bivalves, gastropods, and crustaceans while planktivory in mobulines is considered a derived trait (Ajemian &amp; Powers, 2012; Ajemian et al. 2012; Adnet et al., 2012; Aschliman, 2014).","4255":"Burial is an understudied behavior among flatfish species. This study aims to understand the role of undulations in flatfish burial. Five species of flatfish were filmed using high speed video cameras to assess the speed of the undulations and determine the amount of sand covering the animal after completing burial. A physical model was also built to test the effect of undulation speed on burial. The results of the physical model suggest that increased speed increases the surface area of sand on the burying object; however this benefit has diminishing returns at high speeds. The live animals suggest that undulations are not the only factor involved in flatfish burial. The posterior portion of the dorsal and anal fins may contribute to burial efficiency in these species.","4256":"There are more than ten different species of fishes in the Pacific Northwest with ventral adhesive organs that facilitate adhesion to marine substrates. The performance of these adhesive discs have been measured in three species. These include the Northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus), Pacific spiny lumpsucker (Eumicrotremus orbis), and tide pool snailfish (Liparis florae). While the clingfish that lives in the intertidal zone where waves continually crash down, it is the other two who have been shown to have stronger discs. Scanning electron microscopy and photography of cleared and stained individuals was used to look for differences in morphology that might explain these performance differences. High speed videography was used to determine the mechanism of detachment for E. orbis and L. florae because this is unknown. All three species have different disc morphology (Fig. 1); E. orbis and L. florae have much large papillae than G. maeandricus and a more rigid support to their disc which may help to explain the difference in disc performance. Papillae may increase friction which prevents the disc from slipping and rigid pelvic spines resist bending of the disc. Both E. orbis and L. florae seem to use abduction of their pelvic fins and operculum to brace themselves as they pull back the anterior edge of their disc, causing failure and allowing the disc to be peeled back in the anterior direction. Modeling discs based off these morphologies could be done to create a strong, bio-inspired suction cup for human use.","4257":"The low-intertidal zone marine gastropod, Nucella lamellosa, exhibits remarkable phenotypic plasticity between habitats as close as 100 m from one other. Shells that develop in different environments can display variation in color, banding, shape, sculpture, and thickness, and the most documented explanation for this variation is predator-induced resistance. The snails collected from the beach in front of the Friday Harbor Laboratories are of the thick-shelled variety of N. lamellosa and are known to exhibit a row of teeth within their apertural openings, presumably as a defense against their predator, Cancer productus. I collected 25 of these snails at low tide and took systematic measurements (length, width, weight) to quantify shell size, and I used high resolution images of the apertural openings to measure average tooth height and apertural lengths. I found that, while a majority of the snails (19 out of 25) displayed apertural teeth, there were 5 snails that did not (one snail exhibited drastically different morphology). Of the range of shell lengths I collected (1.03 cm \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 5.84 cm), the largest snail without apertural teeth was 1.93 cm. By comparing shell width and weight to shell length, I determined that there was no significant difference between the way snails with and without apertural teeth developed; both groups showed a significant positive correlation between shell width and weight and shell length. I also found that for those snails with apertural teeth, there was a significant positive correlation between apertural length and apertural tooth height.","4258":"Many marine mollucs deposit their eggs on the substrate encapsulated in distinctive masses, thereby leaving the egg case and embryos vulnerable to possible predators and pathogens. Although it is apparent that many marine gastropods possess chemical anti-predation mechanisms as an adult, it is not known from many species whether or not these compounds are widespread in the egg masses. This study aims to expand our knowledge of egg mass predation examining the feeding behavior of three species of crab when offered egg mass material from three gastropods local to the San Juan Islands. The study includes the dorid nudibranchs Diaulula sandiegensis and Doris montereyensis and the cephalospidean Haminoea virescens. The results illustrate a clear rejection of the egg masses by all three of the crab species tested, suggesting anti-predation mechanisms in the egg masses for all three species of gastropod.","4259":"The relationship between propus size and use of snails as prey in sympatric populations of Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis was investigated. Propal height and propal width increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. Sexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but there was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack of difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is no character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference for the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely due to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between male and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among individual crabs.","4260":"Barnacles are gregarious, suspension-feeding invertebrates. They are found mostly in the intertidal and sub-tidal zones, and densely aggregated to facilitate sexual reproduction by copulation. By living together in dense groups, barnacles can change their local flow environment, potentially altering the behavior or energetics of their neighbors. In this study, I recorded video of small aggregations of the barnacle Balanus glandula and studied whether or not individuals responded to adjacent barnacles in their active feeding behavior by either maintaining synchrony or asynchrony in cirral beating. I found that barnacles do not exhibit any behavior that suggests sensitivity to neighbors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 cirral positions, and that the difference in beating phase between actively feeding individuals follows a periodic function as would be expected when comparing the phase of the two individuals beating independently.","4261":"The Mollusca radula is an intricate organ composed of several rows of teeth running along a chitinous ribbon. Several studies have looked at radula of gastropods but fewer have looked at the radula of Polyplacophora. An observational study comparing morphological differences between species of Mopalian radula, including Mopalia muscosa, Mopalia lignosa and Mopalia ciliata, was conducted. Observations of light microscopy photographs, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) photographs, tooth impressions and video were performed in order to look at differences among species. The results show some major morphological differences among species, such that M. muscosa had more stout teeth whereas M. lignosa had short and narrow teeth and M. ciliata had long, slender teeth. Until now, the differences among the three species of Mopalia have remained unseen.","4262":"The temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima participates in a facultative symbiosis with two genera of unicellular photosynthetic algae. Under stressful conditions such as increased levels of pCO2, anemones expel their algal symbionts causing the anemones to rely more heavily upon heterotrophic feeding. A heavier reliance on heterotrophic feeding could be accomplished by increasing the density of nematocysts. Anthopleura elegantissima individuals were collected from the Friday Harbor Laboratories shoreline (48\u00ac\u221e 32.7646 N, 123\u00ac\u221e 00.5932 W), Washington in June 2014, and the number of nematocyst per \u0152\u00bag of protein was measured to determine if increasing oceanic pCO2 levels will affect the density of nematocysts. The number of nematocyst per \u0152\u00bag of protein was measured again after 7 days in higher (2200 \u0152\u00baatm) or ambient (700 \u0152\u00baatm) pCO2 conditions. There was no difference in the density of nematocysts between individuals kept in different pCO2 levels.","4263":"Suspension feeding is a common feeding strategy among small sessile invertebrates. While active suspension feeders use metabolic energy to draw water through their feeding apparatus, passive suspension feeders depend on local currents to feed (Sponaugle and LaBarbera 1991). Erect colonies of passive suspension feeders therefore face a potential contradiction: how to increase the feeding surface such that sufficient flow will occur, while keeping drag forces on the feeding modules and colony low? Flexibility is a feature of many sessile organisms, and a strategy for dealing with drag: bending or stretching with the current allows for a morphological reconfiguration that alters the drag footprint of the animal. Vogel (1984) argues that this shape deformation can be adaptively useful, and is not necessarily merely a consequence of drag force on the organism. Several studies have investigated the effects of drag on Cnidarian colonies. Harvell and LaBarbera (1985) find that the natural flexibility of Abietenaria rigida (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) colonies reduced drag on and velocity around polyps, in contrast to artificially stiffened colonies, which experienced a much greater drag force. Sponaugle and LaBarbera (1991) find that flexion in Gorgonian colonies in flow appears to function at least in part to reduce local flow velocity around polyps. Other studies (e.g. Hunter 1989) highlight the importance of flow velocity, directionality, and colony architecture in different flow regimes. This study aims to address questions of flexion in the hydroid Obelia geniculata Linnaeus 1758 (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa).","4264":"Many sea anemones aggregate, including Urticina crassicornis (common name: the Christmas or painted anemone). This species occurs on the docks and shores of the Friday Harbor Laboratories as well as the intertidal zones around San Juan Island, Washington. There are many benefits to grouping behavior, such as protection from predators, and propinquity to other reproductive conspecifics. To test wether U. crassicornis migrates in the direction of conspecifics, two anemones of this species were placed in different sections of a Y-maze. The distance traveled by both anemones was recorded. Urticina crassicornis does move; however the context of that movement is unclear. The results are especially interesting in the context of potentially adaptive behavior of anemones as a phylogenetic group.","4265":"Colonial hydrozoans are well known for their phenotypic plasticity. Colonies of the Obelia geniculata (Cnidaria:Hydrozoa) maintain distinctly different zooids that are specialized for different tasks. It is not known, however, whether O. geniculata is capable of modulating the relative numbers of these structures in response to environmental conditions. In this study I subject O. geniculata to feeding regimes designed to simulate starvation, food-limited, and abundant-food conditions, and measure the numbers of each zooid type to see if they respond to these treatments.","4266":"Marine birds are an excellent indicator of the health of the Salish Sea, located in between British Columbia, Canada and Washington State, United States. There have been research projects conducted in the 1970\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and 1990\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s that revealed a significant decrease in seabird populations in the area. However, these projects only focused on the reduction of seabird populations during the winters. Friday Harbor Laboratories is currently attempting to gather data for the summers. During the summer of 2014, four surveys were conducted in one transect of the San Juan Channel. Results revealed an overwhelming majority of alcids, mainly rhinoceros auklets. Most of the seabirds aggregated near the northern and southern ends of the transect surveyed. Comparing the data to the survey results from 2012 and 2013, 2012 had a much higher density of seabirds than in 2013 and 2014. The community composition of the seabirds in the region remained steady over the three years. There is no apparent trend for the aggregation of birds in certain zones within the transect. There is also no apparent pattern with the number of birds seen in relation to tides or current speed. However, there could be a possible correlation with global weather patterns, suggesting that large number of seabirds can be associated with La Nin\u00c3\u00c9a conditions. There is not enough data in the three years of the surveys to confirm any observations.","4267":"Abundance and foraging habits in Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias fannini) are correlated with habitat type, tide phase and height, and group size in False Bay in the San Juan Islands, Washington. We completed field surveys during 9-18 August 2014 at False Bay to examine general heron abundance and strike rate success for different habitats, tide phases and heights, and heron group sizes. Total abundance was assessed along with location in the bay, habitat type, water depth, and tide phase and height for each individual. We assessed strike rate success for individuals, noting the five criteria above as well. The results from foraging observations indicated that herons at False Bay had greater strike rate successes behind the tideline and in deeper water, and during higher and flood tides. Such success patterns could relate to prey abundance, size, and profitability. We also found the success rate of individual herons to be greater when foraging alone or in groups of six or more. These success patterns could be due to competition factors, as well as herons using one another as indicators of food availability. Additionally, we found heron abundance and success rate appear inversely related in some cases, which may be related to prey depletion. Congruent with findings from previous studies, this study indicates a correlation between heron foraging success and the aforementioned habitat, tide, water depth, and group features.","4268":"Two studies were conducted at Cattle Pass, Washington between 13-18 August 2014. The first study was conducted to determine the relationship between tidal height and the haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus) at the Whale Rocks of the San Juan Channel. There was a clear diurnal pattern of abundance during both of the days used for data analysis. The abundance was very low in the morning which may be a result of the nighttime\/early morning foraging behavior characteristic of Steller Sea Lions. It was determined that this variation in haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions did not occur in response to changes in tidal height. The data also suggest that air temperature may play a role in determining the total abundance of Steller Sea Lions. The second study was done to understand how two unrelated bird species, Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), compare and contrast in their use of the Cattle Pass rocky intertidal habitat post-breeding season. It was found that Black Oystercatchers spend most of their time loafing in the region while Harlequin Ducks spend most of their time swimming and foraging. These data suggest that Black Oystercatchers use the habitat primarily as a resting area between flock feedings while Harlequin Ducks use it primarily as a feeding ground during molting periods that cause them to be temporarily flightless.","4269":"Human induced disturbances affect harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) hauled-out off Yellow Island, WA. Disturbances, in this study, include sailboats, motorboats, wake height, and distance of boats to haul-out sites (0 to 200 m). Harbor seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and regulations set by the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), state that no vessels should approach closer than about 100 m to marine mammals. During our study, we observed 41\/71 boats that passed within 100 m of the harbor seals on their haul-out site. We recorded disturbance behavior of harbor seals as vigilance and flushing and recorded their location on the haul-out site as low, waterline to 1 m, and high as any seals above 1 m. Our results indicate that in general, seals below 1 m are more vigilant. During wake disturbances, we recorded a mean vigilance of about 40.2% as compared to those about 1 m up on the haul-out site with a mean vigilance of 8.6% . Again, seals were more vigilant in low areas when comparing distances of boats to vigilance. Out of all the disturbances (i.e. sailboats, motor boats, and wakes), wakes causes the highest amount of vigilance. Our results indicate that regulations set by the NMFS and MMPA need to be revised; specifically the 100 m distance that vessels are required to avoid approaching marine mammals.","4270":"Knowing if rates of vigilance between mother harbor seals and lone adults (Phoca Vitulina) differ in any way is essential in moving conservation efforts in the right direction. We used focal individual and scan samples of harbor seals off of Yellow Island, WA to examine any possible differences in vigilance between the two seal categories at low tides. The result of overall vigilance rates for the seals was inconclusive. However, we did find that mother seals tend to be more vigilant the higher the tide goes, while lone adults had no change. This signifies that the less haul out space available, the more vigilant mothers become. Also, mothers spend less time loafing overall than lone adults and more time swimming, possibly due to the fact they are teaching their young feeding techniques. The data on vigilance rates being relatively equal between the two seal categories is inconsistent with prior studies, possibly due to smaller number of sample days. Overall, this study shows that while vigilance does not change much for mothers, they do spend more time exhibiting other active behaviors and less time resting than lone adults.","4271":"The dive behavior of the Double Crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and the Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) was studied along Cattle Pass of San Juan Island, WA, USA. Dive durations and resting periods were measured for consecutive, sequential dives of each type of cormorant. Comparing the two species, mean dive time was greater for the Pelagic Cormorant. Both species exhibited dive to rest time ratios greater than one (&gt;1) and therefore generate an oxygen debt that must be resupplied after completion of dive bouts. Tidal phase, including tidal height and current speed had an effect on when both species chose to forage. Further analysis of prey abundance and final resting locations in the Cattle Pass region are needed to understand more about the Double Crested and the Pelagic Cormorant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s dive behavior in the San Juan channel.","4272":"Boating traffic can disturb and negatively affect normal behaviors of marine birds, including foraging. Surveys of seabirds were performed on two vessel routes with different types of boat traffic in the San Juan Islands, Washington. Comparisons of data showed that birds were more abundant on the route taken by the Centennial vessel in the San Juan Channel than on the route taken by the Klahowya vessel in the Washington State Ferries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 San Juan Interisland route. Seabird species were non-uniformly distributed both between the two vessel routes and within each vessel route. My study was unable to find a correlation between seabird abundance and tidal state, contrary to established literature. Data on flushing behavior suggest that response to disturbance is variable between species, locations, and vessels causing the disturbance.","4273":"As fisheries grow and the amount of bycatch being thrown back into the oceans rises, studies on the effects of interferences in natural food chain processes that occur throughout the ocean become increasingly important. This study aims to look at scavenging rates at different depths and make preliminary observations about how quickly carrion will be consumed and affect the food chain. Three identical traps were deployed at three different habitats: intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal. The first was pulled up after 6 hours, the second after 12 hours, and the third after 24 hours. All of the species within each trap were counted, identified, recorded, and entered into Primer and Excel to determine the differences between the habitats, the species richness and diversity for each depth, and the percent bait consumption to determine scavenging rates. The results showed that scavenger species varied noticeably at different depths. The shallow subtidal had the highest scavenger diversity and fastest consumption rates. It also seems apparent that scavenging rates in the intertidal are slowest. Therefore, the habitat would probably be most affected by large carrion debris due to slow decomposition, but it would affect upper trophic levels more slowly than in the other habitats. Future studies should be completed at deeper depths, with more replication, and using controls to find more conclusive results.","4274":"The importance of scavenging communities, and the detritus and carrion on which they feed, has been well studied from the perspectives of spatial food subsidies (marine to terrestrial, terrestrial to marine, and marine to marine) and community structure (e.g. whale and wood falls in the deep sea). Most of these studies focus on comparing scavenging rates or scavenger diversity within a single habitat, usually deep-sea or intertidal, and seldom make comparisons between these regions. A baited trap experiment was conducted to quantify the macro-scavenger community and scavenging rates on aged fish and kelp at intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal sites around San Juan Island, WA, USA. Bray Curtis cluster analysis showed a distinction between macrofaunal communities in the intertidal and both subtidal sites, with higher scavenging rates on fish than kelp at all sites. Differences in the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were found in trap macrofaunal communities between sites, although further study is needed to show if these differences are really the result of different communities of scavengers or merely the influx of ambient macrofauna into the traps at different sites.","4275":"Wood falls represent a rare and ephemeral, yet important source of food in the deep-sea. Wood-boring bivalves of the family Xylophagainae have high reproduction and growth rates, allowing them to rapidly colonise and exploit these resources. While efforts have focussed on the taxonomy of this group, there has been less research carried out on reproduction and larval recruitment. Specimens of Xylophaga washingtona were collected from an experimental wood deployment placed at a depth of 1, 605 m for 15 months off the coast of Oregon, USA. Individuals were compared using the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene to test for the presence of multiple cohorts. The analyses revealed genetic differentiation within the population. This suggests that colonisers are arriving in multiple cohorts, as opposed to one single cohort. However, the sample size was extremely low, with poor data quality, and the results of this study should therefore not be considered reliable or conclusive. Future studies on the population genetics of X. washingtona would be valuable in further addressing recruitment of this species.","4276":"Sunken wood in marine environments supports a diverse community, the stars of the show being the wood-boring bivalves. Shallow versus deep-sea woodfalls tend to only attract bivalves from one of two clades; Teredinidae and Xylophagaidae respectively. A recent deployment of experimental wood substrates returned a new form of boring bivalve that has morphological characteristics (mesoplax and lack of viscera in the siphons) indicating it as a xylophagaid, yet has hard pallet-like structures that had previously only been observed in the shallow water teredinids. This study sought to understand the phylogenetic placement of this new taxon (Xylophagaid A) with consideration of the various siphon-associated hard parts that have been described across boring bivalve groups. I sequenced the 18S and 28S rDNA nuclear genes from Xylophagaid A and Xylophaga zierenbergi and aligned these with sequences from Distel et al. (2011) for Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The resulting trees confirm Xylophagaid A as a member of Xylophagaidae and indicate a close relationship to Xyloredo, a genus that has a calcareous tube. Additional taxonomic sampling and closer morphological investigations are required, but this study indicates preliminary evidence for convergence in siphon-associated hard parts in wood-boring bivalves.","4277":"Barkley Canyon is a submarine canyon located on the west continental margin of Vancouver Island, British Columbia in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. This area is known for seasonal upwelling, which accounts for lower, temporally varying oxygen levels along the margin at depth. Oxygen concentration data from in situ CTD\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and video footage, obtained from Ocean Network Canada installations in Barkley Canyon, were used to examine correlations between megafaunal abundance and diversity, and oxygen fluctuations from two sites at Barkley Canyon. The Upper Slope site is located along the slope ridge and at a depth of approximately 400 meters and the Mid-Canyon site is located within the canyon towards the base at approximately 890 meters. There is a decrease in the number of species present at the Mid-Canyon site, in correlation with the decrease in oxygen concentrations. A similar correlation was not observed at the Upper Slope. Oxygen is necessary for most organisms to live, whose importance increases at depths that contain lower oxygen levels than surface waters.","4278":"Benthic macrofauna are a diverse group of organisms found in both deep-sea and shallow-water systems. Understanding the influence of biotic and abiotic factors in shallow-water systems can translate to further understanding inaccessible deep-sea community structure. This study observes the change in community structure as a function of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Altitude Above Mean Low-tide Sea-level\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 (AAML) and distance from shore through push-core sediment sampling. In addition, this study identifies several specimens through genetic barcoding methods. The results show closer relationship among 90cm AAML sites than between any 90cm and 60cm site. Finally, specimens identified through barcoding could not be identified down to a species level. Future population genetic analyses will benefit from increasing accessibility to metagenetics and high-throughput sequencing.","4279":"Ephemeral reducing environments such as hydrothermal vents and whale falls create oases of chemosynthetic primary production in the nutrient poor deep sea. The polychaete family Siboglinidae has adapted to occupy these niches of chemical nutrition. This likely requires high levels of dispersal, either through long-living larvae or a \u201a\u00c4\u00fastepping-stone\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 dispersal method. Here we seek to identify recently found specimens of Osedax from whalebones off the coast of Oregon and Antarctica. Once species identity was determined, we sought to elucidate connectivity between known populations of Osedax from Monterey Bay and Sagami Bay. To accomplish this, we sequenced the mitochondrial marker COI and inferred relationships through a haplotype network and maximum likelihood tree.","4280":"A widely distributed species of wood-boring bivalve, Xylophaga washingtona, was collected from three sites along the Washington-Oregon margin and assessed with molecular techniques. 16S gene sequences revealed low differentiation between individuals from the two sites on the outer continental slope suggesting that these sites harbor a single population. However, greater genetic distance was observed between the slope individuals and those collected from a shallow-water site in the San Juan Islands, Washington. These results suggest the presence of at least two distinct populations of Xylophaga washingtona along the Washington-Oregon margin and the potential for species-level differences. The juxtaposition of the two hydrographic settings supports the hypothesis that isolation of the shallow-water population has resulted in sufficient genetic differentiation over fairly short geographic distances. Further research is needed to verify these observed patterns and to explore whether morphological differences support the proposed population and species structure.","4281":"The free-spawning species of chitons produce eggs that are enclosed in a capsule known as the hull. Particularly in the group of Chitonida, this outer coat is formed by spine projections. Previous studies have identified the function of the hull as a \"sperm guide\" that facilitates the fertilization of the eggs, and one has suggested that this hull also serves to slow down the sinking rates of the eggs. In this study, I present concrete evidence showing that the hull does reduce the sinking rates of eggs in the chiton species Mopalia ciliata, acting as flotation device, as a consequence of its lower density compared to sea water and the egg without this structure. Additionally, changes during ontogeny in behavior, swimming velocities, and body shape of the larvae of this species were analyzed. Over time, the larvae decrease their tendency to swim up and prefer to stay in the bottom, and the body becomes elongated. These changes may be related to preparation for settle and metamorphosis into a juvenile. This study shows the importance of the hull structure in the sinking rates of the chitons eggs, and the ontogenetic changes in behavior and form that the larvae present, encouraging further studies to evaluate the ecological impact of these aspects in the persistence of the species.","4282":"Intertidal organisms face highly variable environments with a multitude of stresses placed on them. Freshwater input from rain and run off is one such stress. Salinity changes have been shown to have adverse developmental effects on embryos of intertidal organisms. Although these organisms have developed different mechanisms by which larvae and embryos cope with stresses, relatively little has been demonstrated on the range of environmental stresses the eggs are able to tolerate. In this study adults and egg masses of the sacogloassan sea slug, Alderia modesta (Love\u00c3\u00c5n 1844), were subjected to acute salinity stress to determine the consequences for reproduction and embryonic development to hatching, respectively. New egg masses that had been laid at constant salinity were exposed to varying salinity (7-37ppt) stress within 12 hours of deposition. Adults were exposed to varying salinity while reproducing and the egg masses they subsequently produced were compared between ambient and experimental conditions. Hatching success of eggs was significantly higher at intermediate salinities, with zero hatching success at the lowest salinity treatment (7ppt), and delayed development with low (10%) success at the highest treatment. When exposed to the same acute salinity stresses, adults did not lay egg masses so no comparative data was collected. These results show tolerance to and development in lower salinity than previous studies, providing evidence that successful reproduction might be less restricted by conditions of embryonic development.","4283":"The behavior of sea star brachiolaria larvae is poorly understood and the role of their elongated posterior processes in swimming is unknown. We attempt to characterize swimming speed and behavior in the late stage brachiolaria of Pisaster ochraceus in order to form a metric for larval health and to better understand the role of larval behavior in feeding and dispersal potential. We found that larvae swim faster in the presence of food and sink at a consistent rate when cilia are removed, which does not vary linearly with body or process length. In a simulation of simplified model brachiolaria in horizontal shear flow, larvae with their posterior processes parallel were more stable, while larvae with angled processes began to tumble at lower levels of shear. Further investigation will use video analysis to assess larval movement in varying levels of vertical shear that we created in a column using a rotating belt.","4284":"The benefits of spines in zoea and other crustaceans have been documented in numerous studies as a form of anti-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eapredatory behavior. This study examined the potential costs of having spines using three different methods. Drag forces on spines were calculated using hydrodynamic equations and compared between zoea models with long and short spines; clay models were used in corn syrup sinking rate experiments to measure drag coefficients; and zoea models were created in FreeCAD and ran through a shear simulation in MATLAB to examine their stabilities. The study found that the presence of spines increased the drag forces on the models both through calculations and through direct measurements in corn syrup. Moreover, the presence of spines made models more susceptible to tumbling under shear when the spines were flared. However, if long spines were held in typical positions, the zoea models were actually more stable than the short spined model. This study highlights some of the plausible costs associated with spines and further studies are needed to examine the relative importance between hydrodynamic costs in spines versus decreased risk in predation.","4285":"Planktonic larval development, common in many benthic marine invertebrates, is associated with both costs and benefits relative to benthic larval development. Costs of being in the plankton include increased susceptibility to advection away from habitat and starvation. Potential benefits include reduction in predation for pelagic larvae. Few studies have measured predation rates on larvae in the field. Even fewer have directly observed larval predation events, documented the specific predator, mode of predation, and intervals between predator attacks. In this study we investigated benthic and pelagic differences in predator assemblage and predation interval on megalopae of the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. To observe the predation events, we combined methods of tethering larvae with automated motion analysis of underwater camera images from daytime deployments off the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories, Friday Harbor, WA. We measured number of predation events, the interval in which those events happened, the species of predator, and of other non-predator species that comprised each visible community. Predation was higher on the benthos than the surface, with more total strikes and a shorter interval to predation. Only one predator species was seen during the trials, Artedius harringtoni. These results are consistent with previous studies, and support the novel combination of methods to better inform predation interactions of communities and their relative importance on each species.","4286":"The relative rates of mortality in benthic and pelagic environments have been proposed as a major factor structuring the evolution of complex benthic invertebrate life histories. Field methods, such as tethering, have provided indispensable measurements of mortality under natural conditions for the larvae of benthic invertebrates. However, few such field studies have examined mortality rates of benthic invertebrates' early life stages in size classes less than 1 mm. Here, we tethered egg capsules to quantify how rates of predation vary with environmental gradients, especially distance from the benthic substratum and flow velocity. We found that predation is consistently high on L. scutulata egg capsules and invariant at four positions in the water column and on the benthic substratum (average 34% loss across all treatments). Instead, the flow environment had the greatest effect on predation rate. We hypothesize that higher predation in the faster flow environment was due to higher encounter rates with advected predators.","4287":"The larval swimming patterns prior to settlement play an important role in geographic dispersal and genetic connection for sessile marine organisms. This study examined how swimming patterns and size change with age for larvae of the bryozoan, Bugula c.f. californica. We observed three different swimming patterns, including upward swimming, downward swimming, and sinking which were observed every hour post hatch for four hours until the onset of settlement each day. We used analysis of digital photographs to measure the body length and width of larvae within the same cohort. Almost all early stage larvae swam up to the top in the first hour, but in later stages larvae changed their swimming pattern to swim down or sink. Upward velocity averaged at about 2mm per second and decreased over time, and in the fourth hour the larvae started to sink at about 2mm per second. In addition, there is no significant difference among the values of the lengths or widths of the larvae over time, but these phenotypic characteristics did vary within the age cohorts.","4288":"One of the arguments for the persistence of planktonic larval stages in the life cycles of benthic marine invertebrates is that pelagic larvae experience a release from predation when they move off the benthos and into the water column. However, it is difficult to substantiate this hypothesis because we lack comparative data on mortality rates of unprotected (e.g., not in egg capsules or gelatinous masses) embryos and larvae on the benthos and in the water column. The aim of this study was to provide some of this missing information, by comparing development success in benthic and pelagic environments. Dendraster excentricus embryos were placed in enclosed development chambers under three treatment conditions: 1) directly on the substratum (unscreened benthic), 2) on a screen on the substratum (screened benthic), and 3) on a screen raised 3 cm above the substratum (screened pelagic). Development success for pelagic embryos was consistently higher than those on the benthos, substantiating the hypothesis that embryos experience a release from predation as they move off the benthos. In addition, the screened benthic treatment had significantly higher development success than the unscreened benthic treatment, indicating that macro-predators (&gt;55 \u0152\u00bam) may significantly reduce development success for unprotected larvae. Higher development success of protected pelagic treatments may have been due to lower abundances of pelagic micro-predators or anoxic conditions on the benthos.","4289":"A recent outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) along the U.S. West coast has decimated populations of many intertidal and subtidal sea star species. If populations are unable to recover quickly, SSWS is likely to cause significant changes to rocky intertidal and subtidal community structure and functioning in the Northeast Pacific ocean. Recovery will likely depend in large part on the success of larval recruitment, but the impacts of SSWS on larvae are unknown. We raised embryos and early stage P. ochraceus larvae in treatments of sea water that varied in filtration exposure to potential pathogens of SSWS. We assessed treatment impacts on larval survival development and larval size. We found a significant effect of water treatment and filtration level on two measures of larval survival. Further studies are needed to better understand the direction and magnitude of these and other effects of SSWS on larval fitness.","4290":"The sensory organs of larvae of the bryozoan Bugula c.f. californica are very important during the short transition from the swimming phase to the brief settlement phase. These sensory organs detect environmental cues that initiate and regulate settlement within a favorable habitat. However, these organs may also allow the larvae to perceive unfavorable habitat and avoid predation. This study looked at the settlement response of the competent larvae of Bugula c.f. californica when they came in contact with traces of a predatory nudibranch, Janolus fuscus, with a known positive settlement cue (biofilm), and with traces of a non-predatory nudibranch, Archidoris montereyensis. A known number of larvae were kept in small petri dishes filled with filtered seawater at about 12 degrees Celsius with no flow inside the dishes. Prior to adding the newly released larvae, the petri dishes were divided into four groups that were smeared with the three following treatments: mucus from the predatory nudibranch, mucus from the non-predatory nudibranch, and a thin layer of biofilm. Clean (un-filmed) dishes with FSW served as the control. A second study looked at preferential settlement with the known positive- biofilm, the biofilm substratum with predatory water, and 1\u201a\u00c5\u00d12 biofilm substratum next to 1\u201a\u00c5\u00d12 predatory mucus substratum. We found that the larvae in the biofilm with FSW settled early in their planktonic period. The larvae in the dishes with predator mucus, dishes with biofilm and predator water, in dishes with a choice of biofilm or predator mucus delay their settlement- perhaps in search of optimal habitats. Furthermore, when the biofilm and predator mucus exist in the same dish, the larvae preferentially settle in the side with biofilm, which suggests that they try to avoid potential predation.","4291":"Sea stars are common invertebrates that inhabit all oceans. These organisms belong to the phylum Echinodermata, which include sea cucumbers, sand dollars and sea urchins. The sea star Pisaster ocharaceus is native to the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Northern Alaska to Northern California. They appear in different color morphs, ranging from purple to orange and even brown. Like other sea stars they have tube feet, which give them the ability to move and secure themselves on any surface, making it difficult for predators, including humans to obtain it. They normally thrive on common bivalves such as muscles, but also consume barnacles and chitons, however during their larval stage they mostly feed on algae. Using their tube feet they can latch on to different prey and bring them to their mouth to feast. Pisaster ochraceus is known to have its mating Pisaster sea stars have separate sexes, which can be determined by making a slight incision at the base of the arm and locating the gonads, which will contain either sperm or eggs. . Many sea stars have the capacity to regenerate body parts lost during their lifetime, but only in their adult stages. However, I am more interested in learning about this mechanism during their larval stage. Not only does regeneration affect different organs in the specimen, but also different cells (Carnevali 2006). This paper will show the processes of obtaining the specimens, bisecting the larval sea stars, and finally displaying them in different colors, allowing viewers to not only see the common organs such as the mouth, anus, esophagus and stomach, but also different muscle tissues. In this study, we investigate the regenerative abilities of 200 larvae bisected in various morphological planes and fixed over a series of time points to observe the progress of each bisected culture.","4292":"Wnt signaling is known to be critical for proper embryonic development in most animals studied to date15. But key evolutionary questions on the origin and evolution of this pathway in the metazoan common ancestor are still unresolved. Recently, the genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, a member of the early branching metazoan linage ctenophora, has been sequenced. Insights into the function of the Wnt pathway in P. bachei will provide information on early evolution of this key pathway. Three Wnt ligand genes were identified in P. bachei and cloned for in situ hybridization. These genes showed expression in the combs, tentacles, mouth, ciliated grooves and polar fields of the adult P. bachei. In a genomic search for other members of the canonical Wnt pathway, components of the destruction complex and antagonists were incomplete or missing from the genome. Wnt expression in the adult P. bachei indicates that Wnt could also be playing a role in neurotransmission in the adult.","4293":"In this study, we investigated how intertidal algal canopies affect susceptibility of limpets to predation and also how the temperature experienced by limpets at low tide affects limpet susceptibility to predation at high tide. Specifically, we studied the effects of habitat amelioration by Saccharina sessilis and Fucus distichus on L. scutum populations. We hypothesized that in the F. distichus zone (during the low tide), predation would be high in open areas (because limpets in these areas are visible to foraging bird predators), and that predation would be low under the F. distichus canopy (because limpets would be hidden from bird predators during low tide exposure). Secondly, we hypothesized that in the S. sessilis zone, predation would be higher under the canopy (because sea stars commonly reside under the canopy to avoid stress from the low tide (Burnaford, 2001) 4 than in open areas during the high tide. Additionally, we investigated how long it takes L. scutum to recover from heat stress and regain their escape responses after low tide exposure. We predicted that limpets exposed to cooler low tides (simulating conditions under a shaded algal canopy) would recover their escape responses faster than limpets exposed to warm low tides (simulating conditions in open sun-exposed intertidal areas).","4294":"Suction feeding is the most common vertebrate feeding mode. Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 length3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 muscle cross-sectional area \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 length2). Since suction volume increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Previous studies show that great sculpin counter the force deficit with increased jaw leverage and more force production at longer fish lengths. In this study, we examined muscle force and muscle strain variation across sizes in the suction- feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Because muscles are subject to the limitations of the length-tension relationship, we saw maximum force (P0) production at intermediate muscle lengths (L0) and declining forces at longer\/shorter muscle lengths. Our results show that great sculpin maintain a constant amount of muscle strain to achieve at least 50% of their maximum force (P0) throughout ontogeny. As the great sculpin grows, it uses a wider range of this available muscle strain in feeding, stretching its muscles away from L0 and losing force in the process. Thus in addition to an increasing muscle force deficit, larger great sculpin experience declining jaw-closing forces due to the length-tension properties of jaw- closing muscles.","4295":"Crabs use their claws for a number of uses including handling and processing of prey items. However claws are not uniform across species, they show a number of variations including those in their denticle patterns. To investigate these variations individuals from the species Glebocarcinus oregonensis, Chionoecetes bairdi, Pugettia producta, and Oregonia gracilis were collected and the morphology of the crabs\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 claws were measured. The measurements included the radius of curvature of the denticles and distance of these denticles along the claw. From these measurements we made predictions about potential prey type preference for each species. To test these predictions the crabs were put through choice and no choice feeding trials. Food types tested included kelp, snail, and shrimp species. We found that all the crab species in this study showed difference in their claw morphologies as well as their feeding preferences. G. oregonensis showed a preference for snails while the other species consumed more shrimp or kelp. However despite these differences all four species consumed shrimp as a first or second choice.","4296":"With more anthropogenic CO2 equilibrating with the oceans and decreasing the concentration of carbonate ions, ocean acidification is a current concern for all marine organisms, especially those that build calcium carbonate shells like the Olympia Oyster. This study looks at the effect of elevated pCO2 levels with a subsequent heat shock on the mortality rates of juvenile Olympia Oysters. The oysters were bred from adults at Totten Inlet. The juveniles were exposed to pH levels of 7.27, 7.64 and 8.02 and then put through a sub lethal and lethal heat shock. Unexpectedly, the oysters from the lowest pH level seemed to have higher survival rates than the oysters from the highest pH level. This could be attributed to the release of the chaperone protein that can help the organism with a secondary stress.","4297":"The development of larval fishes is a chronically understudied, critically important field, which offers broad insight into a defining period in the life history of fishes. Examinations of development shed light on the behavior and ecology of fishes at a stage wherein they are difficult to observe directly. We cleared and stained 36 specimens of the soft sculpin, Psychrolutes sigalutes, in an effort to link morphological development to preexisting studies on their behavioral shifts with growth. Rapid development of feeding structures suggests a fish that quickly grows into a highly capable hunter, well-suited to its lengthy transitional feeding period in the plankton. Given the intense focus of development on hunting, we believe that transforming P. sigalutes may be the apex predators in their habitat, possibly responsible for the top-down control of local ichyhtoplankton.","4298":"The meiofaunal assemblage on the invasive brown alga, Sargassum muticum, was compared to that on three native algal species. I predicted that differences in the meiofaunal diversity, abundance, and community composition would be influenced by the morphological complexity and palatability of an alga. I found that the algal structural palatability, rather than chemical palatability, was a factor in the preferences of one genus of meiofauna (Lacuna sp.). The results also suggest that the level of structural complexity of an alga determines its relative abundance of meiofauna, while the type of structural complexity determines its meiofaunal community composition. Even though Sargassum did not support a lower diversity of meiofauna compared to each individual native species, a monoculture of Sargassum would support a less diverse community of meiofauna compared to a diverse community of native seaweeds.","4299":"Beaches world-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eawide have low primary production due to a stressful environment and action of strong hydrodynamic forces. For this reason, input from marine wrack as well as terrestrial debris is an important source of production in food webs. Wrack can also provide food and habitat for meiofauna that help transfer nutrients up the food web. These interactions have been examined on sandy beaches, but not on gravel beaches. I examined the relationship between beach wrack type, nutrient leaching, and meiofauna colonization on a gravel beach in San Juan County, WA. I used three different types of wrack: Fucus disticus, Zostera marina, and leaves from Prunus avium (Cherry). I conducted two different experiments: a nutrient leaching experiment by measuring nitrate and phosphate leaching from wrack over seven weeks relative to seawater controls with daily tidal simulation, and a community composition experiment using wrack-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eafilled packets placed on a gravel beach. Both nitrate and phosphate showed similar patterns across all wrack types. Nitrate was absorbed by all wrack types at the beginning of the experiment, released in the middle, then absorbed again at the end. Phosphate was absorbed by Zostera and Fucus (though released by cherry) at the beginning, then released by all types of wrack, then all types had similar nutrients as seawater. Diversity of meiofauna was significantly correlated with final weight of the wrack inside the packets. Diversity of meiofauna changed significantly across type of wrack by date sampled. My data suggest that external factors such as bacteria, weather, and decomposition are more important than wrack type in nutrient leaching and community composition.","4300":"Prevalent upwelling in summer months in the Northwest United States can bring anomalously acidified waters to Puget Sound. This, combined with the effects of increasing summer peak water temperatures, poses a joint threat from two separate abiotic factors directly linked to climate change. We investigated the response in mortality of Olympia Oysters, Ostrea lurida, to these two factors by pretreating oysters in three different pH conditions for different lengths of time before exposing them to a three-day lethal and sublethal heat shock with different day and night temperatures. We were able to determine the lethal and near-sublethal temperature for Olympia oysters in a three-day heat shock as 41\u00ac\u221eC and 36\u00ac\u221eC, respectively. When analyzing mortality, our experiment yielded ambiguous statistical results but did indicate that oysters pretreated in low pH conditions may have less mortality in a lethal heat shock than oysters in high pH conditions. This suggests that Olympia oysters could be able to develop resistance to a primary stress after previous exposure to an unrelated secondary stress. We plan to investigate morphological and structural qualities of these oyster shells to determine what additional effects the various pH pretreatments might have had on the oysters.","4301":"Zooplankton are secondary producers that play a major role in carbon sequestration, the microbial loop, and energy transfer across trophic levels. Zooplankton are abundant in the Salish Sea, a productive inland sea with a complex estuarine circulation that is subject to seasonal physical processes. We studied the zooplankton composition in the Salish Sea and measured the relation of biotic factors to water properties. We estimated zooplankton abundance and diversity in the San Juan Channel and compared to broader Salish Sea and five physical factors (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence, and dissolved inorganic carbon). The most abundant zooplankton in the Salish Sea was calanoid copepod. However, copepod nauplii were more abundant at North station during the beginning of the sampling period. The fall transition marked a steady zooplankton density decrease. Salinity and dissolved oxygen had a strong correlation with total zooplankton abundance, copepod abundance, and % of copepods with lipid content. Zooplankton abundance and composition in late October reflected how downwelling conditions and river flow, among other oceanographic variables, greatly affect spatial zooplankton distribution. The spatial variation of zooplankton, influenced by tides and the fall transition, was pronounced in the estuary and may be due to different water properties at the sampled stations.","4302":"Two species of pinnipeds were focused on in this study, the Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), and the Steller sea lion (Eumatopias jubatus). In this study the abundance and distribution of Harbor seals and Steller sea lions in the San Juan Channel was studied in fall 2014 using the strip transect method. Results were compared with data collected by previous Pelagic Ecosystem Function Research Apprenticeship students from fall 2007- 2013. Harbor seal numbers were found to be stable, but steller sea lion\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s numbers have been declining for the past three years. Over the course of fall 2014 harbor seal numbers declined, possibly due to the fall transition, while steller sea lion numbers stayed low throughout the season. Steller sea lion haulout patterns were also examined at Cattle Pass, Washington, and found to have a correlation with current speed.","4303":"The Salish Sea in an estuarine circulation system comprising of the Fraser River in Canada and the Pacific Ocean. Stratification in the San Juan Channel is variable by two very distinctly different means in the north and in the south of the channel. This study examined the variability of tidal forcing on the San Juan Channel. NANOOS archived data, 2004-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00ea2013 for the north channel and 2008-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00ea2013 for the south channel along with 2014 PEF data, was used to analyze salinity data values. A subsample was taken from the salinity data depending on the resulting standard deviations. Every subsample was then classified by being either flood-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00easpring, flood-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eaneap, ebb-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00easpring, ebb-\u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00eaneap using a dyadic relationship. In the southern channel, there was a large saline intrusion at depth due to a Pacific Ocean exchange from tidal forcing during a flood cycle. The salinity in the northern part of the channel had variability that could not be explained through tidal height. When the standard deviations were very small, all four classifications were found to have very strong mixing throughout the water column in both the north and south of the San Juan Channel.","4304":"The relationship between pteropod shell dissolution and waters undersaturated with aragonite has been well documented (Bednarsek et al 2012). Low aragonite saturation levels decrease the availability of carbonate ions in the water column, causing aragonite to dissolve out of pteropod shell structures. The onset of ocean acidification has decreased the aragonite saturation states across the globe. While studies along the Washington coast have documented widespread pteropod dissolution during peak upwelling season, the state of pteropods during other seasons is unknown (Bednarsek et al 2014). Pteropods exposed to pCO2 levels that exist within the Puget Sound have experienced dissolution in situ, but there has been no study done to date that examines the state of pteropods in the Puget Sound (Busch et al 2014). This study found widespread pteropod dissolution off the coast of Washington during the downwelling season with saturated surface waters, suggesting that even partial undersaturation of the water column can have deleterious effects on pteropod shells. Two stations examined from within the Puget Sound found severe dissolution in all pteropod samples and highly undersaturated waters, pointing towards conditions that are unsuitable for pteropods within the Puget Sound. While it is outside of this scope of this study to definitively conclude that ocean acidification is driving this, it is likely contributing to these damaging states.","4305":"The Salish Sea, an area of complex oceanography and bathymetry, supports a number of apex cetacean species. In the last decade, anomalous sightings of cetaceans have become more frequent and shifts in species abundance have occurred. This 2014 Pelagic Ecosystem Function (PEF) study, using large and fine scale surveys in the San Juan Channel (SJC), determined that cetacean mean density was unusually low but species composition was more diverse than previous years, perhaps due to anonymously warm surface water. The relationship between tides, bathymetry and harbor porpoise abundance at small scales were different than those found previously in the region.","4306":"Previous studies have found that the Pacific Sand Lance prefer to bury into sediment that is mainly composed of coarse sand and low gravel. This study explored whether that was the case for sand lance buried in the sand wave field in the San Juan Channel in fall 2014. This study also investigated trends and correlations between fish size and sediment composition and compared these results to data from fall 2012 and fall 2013 in the sand wave field. Results showed no strong relationship between fork length and sediment size but did find large fish (110mm and larger) were found in areas of very high coarse sand and low gravel, which contrasted results found in 2012. Although this research was not able to definitively associate size of fish with age, this suggests that larger fish, as a group, are using and responding to benthic habitat in ways that are common among that group but distinct from smaller\/younger fish.","4307":"Forage fish play an important role in wasp-waist ecosystems like that of the San Juan Archipelago. These small fish, including the Pacific sand lance, silver surf perch, and Pacific herring, regulate the flow of energy through the trophic levels of this marine ecosystem, from the plankton to the larger predatory fish, sea birds, and marine mammals. Gut content analyses reveal that Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring feed primarily on calanoid copepods, while the surf perch has a more varied diet. Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring had low values on Levins\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 standardized measure of niche breadth, indicating a narrow dietary breadth characteristic of a specialized diet. Surf perch had a higher value, indicating a wider dietary breadth and more generalist feeding approach. Morista\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s measure of niche overlap was used to quantify dietary overlap between the species. Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring had a high rating, which could indicate competition for the same prey items. Both of these species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 dietary overlap with surf perch was much lower, suggesting little competition for prey items. The diet composition of surf perch exhibited significant temporal variation. The diet composition of Pacific sand lance did not exhibit significant temporal variation, but did exhibit significant spatial variation between Jackson Beach and the sand wave channel. By quantifying these measures of compositional, temporal, and spatial variation in forage fish diets, we can now better understand the types of resource partitioning that are influencing trophic exchange in the San Juan Archipelago.","4308":"Large populations of diving seabirds are found in the San Juan Archipelago, an important overwintering region for many seabirds. Previous Pelagic Ecosystem Function Apprenticeships have focused on the relationships of various diving seabirds and tidal conditions. Cormorants are the second most abundant diving seabirds of the San Juan Channel yet their feeding ecology is not commonly investigated. My objectives were to contribute to the long term seabird database by studying the abundance of all seabirds seen in the San Juan Channel during fall 2014 and comparing this information to recent autumns. I also explored cormorants by relating their abundance to previous autumns and distribution along the six zones for fall 2014. I observed their flight direction and water interaction in the most tidally active area (zone 5) to determine during which tidal conditions they flew in and out of the channel. The population of cormorants increased as the season progressed, likely due to the migration of Brandt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s cormorants to the region, with numbers highest in areas containing rookeries and tidally influenced prey abundance. A significant correlation between cormorant flight direction and fast tidal currents was found at Cattle Pass although they flew in the opposite direction of the current flow. I examined cormorant water interactions within the channel and found they were indeed in the water (proxy for foraging) on fast ebbing tides, reinforcing the countercurrent flight direction I observed at Cattle Pass. My results suggest that cormorants are very different from other diving seabirds and must be studied carefully. Additionally, my analyses confirm population declines for gulls and alcids which are likely due to the anomalously warm offshore ocean water.","4309":"Fish feeding behavior, abundance, and population demographics depend on a number of environmental and non-environmental factors. Some fish, such as salmonids, display cyclic population structures and year class strength that are independent of their environment (Selbie 2008), whereas other fish are strongly influenced by light (Friedlaender et al. 2009), temperature (Cowx and Frear 2004) and tides (Witt 2011). Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) exhibited potential cyclic structures in previous studies, making them ideal for this abundance and population demographic study. Sand lance were collected from the San Juan archipelago and were examined to determine within-day, seasonal, and inter-annual patterns between: foraging behavior and light, time, and tides; abundance (catch per unit effort, CPUE), condition (condition factor, K), and age group structures. Together, these data suggest that sand lance foraging behavior is influenced tidal heights, although greater resolution is needed to determine the effects of other environmental conditions. Across larger temporal scales, local sand lance populations were in much lower condition that in previous years, suggesting the fall of 2014 had unusual environmental conditions. Finally, the sand lance exhibited a cyclic population structure with regards to year class strength, although not in abundance patterns. Further studies in sand lance abundance and population demographics would be useful to confirm this pattern.","4310":"Estuarine density gradient circulation patterns depend on seasonal and tidal temperature and salinity shifts. Changes to these properties affect the residence time and flushing of each fjord-like basin. Abnormal temperature and river discharge measurements in the Puget Sound in the fall of 2014 provided an interesting context to study the seasonal fall transition features from upwelling to downwelling. Using a CTD over the 7 week sampling period we looked at temperature and salinity in the San Juan Channel as well as October 23-31 in the Strait of Juan de Fuca (SJF) and Puget Sound basins. The Fall Transition occurred October 12th; our data showed evidence of the shift a week later in the San Juan Channel. External factors such as extensive freshwater input and abnormal SST off the coast interfered with typical temperature and salinity dynamics after the fall transition. Surface waters sampled in the SJF were much higher than predicted. The combination of seasonal and global climate forcing caused temperatures to be warmer after the transition with depth in the SJF and Hood Canal. San Juan Channel measured 1 - 2\u00ac\u222b C warmer than the 10 year Pelagic Ecosystem Function baseline, and was 1 - 2\u00ac\u222b C cooler than measurements throughout Puget Sound.","4311":"Diurnal exposure to air during fluctuating tides and forces imposed by rushing waves make the intertidal zone, the habitat of the Northern clingfish, uniquely difficult to survive in. The goals of this study were to answer (1) what are the relevant wave forces acting upon the fish on the San Juan Island and (2) how do changing water levels and thus daily time spent under water percentages (DTUW%) affect their distribution? Dynamometers were built and distributed at 3 locations on the San Juan Island to measure the maximum wave velocities. Results show that over all, wave velocities acting on the island do not exceed 4m\/s. Clingfish may have the ability to withstand higher velocities than those measured. A transect was set up at the Reuben Tarte (RT) beach and fish distribution was recorded during the lowest tides between June 30, 2014-July30, 2014. Water heights to reach MLLW were calculated at RT using the law of cosine and these values were later correlated to NOAA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s daily water levels to find DTUW%. Clingfish were found exclusively in areas that had at least 80 DTUW% which leads to the conclusion that water levels and thus DTUW% are important determinants in clingfish survival.","4312":"Within the last 100 years, the arrival in the Pacific Northwest of the invasive European slug Arion rufus has introduced a potential competitor for the iconic banana slug Ariolimax columbianus, the second largest terrestrial slug in the world. We conducted transect studies in three habitats (cedar forest, Doug fir forest, and grasslands) on San Juan Island, WA, to examine the relative demographics of these slugs and note possible food sources. Utilizing those data, we conducted feeding preference studies across leaves from 16 local plant species, incorporating slugs from the two species from different source habitats, different size classes, and both the black and brown morphs of Arion rufus, which tend to specialize in different habitats. We used ImageJ to measure the area eaten from each leaf and calculated feeding rates. The feeding preferences of Ariolimax columbianus were consistent across size classes and source populations, and the two color morphs and various source populations of Arion rufus were also largely consistent within this species. While both species are generalists, they demonstrated feeding preferences that frequently overlapped, indicating that Ariolimax columbianus may compete with Arion rufus for food resources.","4313":"Many marine gastropods face the challenge of adhering to substrates under adverse flow conditions. Some species live on both solid and sedimentary substrates, although how these substrate generalists resist detachment from materials with fundamentally different mechanical properties is not well studied. We used field observations and flow tank experiments to compare the capabilities and tactics of Haminoea vesicula, an opisthobranch gastropod, when exposed to destabilizing flow on its native sand and eelgrass. Velocities of outgoing and incoming spring tides in the tidal creeks and over and within eelgrass beds where H. vesicula live at False Bay, San Juan Island, WA ranged from 1 to 30 cm\/s. In a flow tank, snails\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 resistance to current depended on substrate and orientation. On eelgrass, snails moving into flow maintained their position at velocities exceeding 40 cm\/s, but were more vulnerable when facing away or sideways to flow (falling off at mean velocities of 25 and 32 cm\/s respectively). In the latter orientation, snails would often rotate into flow by hooking onto the leading edge of eelgrass with the anterior edge of the cephalic shield. In this position, snails resisted flows exceeding 40 cm\/s. Snails crawling on sediment and exposed to turbulent flow drew sediment-encrusted mucus sheets dorsally, completely ensheathing their bodies. \u201a\u00c4\u00faSheeting\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 significantly increased snails\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 effective weight and ability to resist flow. On sand, snails ensheathed in sediment were least stable in the sideways orientation compared to those facing into or away from flow (mean velocities of 13 vs. 20 and 23 cm\/s). Experiments on sandpaper indicated that snails were destabilized on sediment due to failure of adhesion of the sedimentary layers beneath them rather than their attachment to the sand.","4314":"The earth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s oceans are becoming more acidic due to absorption of atmospheric CO2. Ocean acidification decreases the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater, and imposes increased energy costs on organisms that deposit calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Larval stages of these organisms are especially vulnerable to stresses of acidification and nutrition, which may have a common energetic basis. We investigated how acidification and nutrition affected pre-competent larval growth of the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata during the first 8 days after hatching. We also asked if a four-day period of food and\/or acidification stress, applied to older competent larvae, affected speed of metamorphosis and juvenile growth after stresses were relieved. Treatments in both experiments used all 4 combinations of pH 7.8 or 7.4, and high or low food concentration (15x104 or 1x104 cells\/ml Isochrysis galbana). Lower food level in the pH 7.8 treatments resulted in decreased growth rates for pre-competent larvae (p&lt;0.0001), while larvae failed to grow in the pH 7.4 treatments regardless of food level. Competent larvae were unaffected by either pH or nutrition level over the course of a four-day stress period indicated by their inability to grow. Increased acidification extended the latency of KCl-induced metamorphosis in the second experiment (p &lt; 0.0309), but nearly all larvae completed metamorphosis within 24 hours. Together, acidification and low food availability decreased subsequent juvenile growth in the first 6 days after metamorphosis (p&lt;0.01), demonstrating latent effects of larval experience.","4315":"In a dynamic environment such as the rocky marine intertidal zone, the stresses experienced by epibionts and their hosts may differ when these animals are engaged in symbioses compared with when they are attached alone to the surrounding rock. We compared the species composition of the epibiotic community on gastropod shells to that of colonizers on neighboring rock surfaces to determine whether intertidal zone, wave action, or basibiont identity affected the epibionts present. We examined two tidal heights (a lower Saccharina sessilis zone and a higher Fucus gardneri\/Semibalanus cariosus zone) at three sites of varying wave exposure (Westside Preserve, Cattle Point, and Colin\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Cove) on San Juan Island, WA. In the lower tidal zone (but not in the higher), the percent of unfouled snails was much greater than predicted based on the surrounding substratum. Fewer than four algal species dominated the substratum at both tidal heights, but the identity of the dominant algae differed between tidal heights and did not match the dominant epibiotic species. Instead, small individuals of the barnacles Semibalanus cariosus and Balanus glandula, spirorbid worms, an excavating alga, an excavating sponge, and diatoms were the most prevalent epibionts. While the basibiotic gastropods were less fouled than we expected overall, we found heavily-fouled individuals (especially limpets) interspersed among unfouled individuals. We deployed cleaned empty shells, either sanded (\u201a\u00c4\u00faweathered\u201a\u00c4\u00f9) or intact, of the gastropod species Tectura scutum, Lottia digitalis, Nucella canaliculata, and Nucella lamellosa for 3 to 6 weeks in the higher intertidal zone and subtidally at two sites. Differences in settlement of epibionts seemed more due to microhabitat effects than to shell morphology, but it is hard to generalize from such short-term settlement studies.","4316":"Climate Change affects the physical conditions of many environments. Increased temperature causes ice extent to decrease worldwide (IPCC, 2013). Glacier runoff during the spring and summer months increases the amount of freshwater pouring into the ocean creating salinity fluctuations. Surface salinity in the ocean can drop from~30ppt to ~21ppt. These fluctuations affect many marine organisms such as the sea star Pisaster ochraceus that cannot osmoregulate. P. orchraceus produces planktotrophic larvae that will also endure the fluctuations of salinity. The present study investigated whether differences in occurrence and intensity of salinity fluctuations at two locations in the Pacific Northwest cause sea stars to produce eggs and larvae with different protein profiles. Eggs and larvae from Snug Harbor with less influx of fresh water from the Fraser River and Cantilever Point with more, were exposed in the laboratory to two and four salinity fluctuations respectively during their development. Low salinity varied between 20 and 22 ppt and high salinity between 30 and 32 ppt. The length, width, and stomach width were noted and protein profiles obtained for larvae in control and fluctuating salinity treatments. Significant differences were observed between treatments for larvae from Snug Harbor, a site less influenced by the Fraser River. Larvae in the controls were significantly bigger than those reared in fluctuating salinity. No significant differences in larval size were observed for larvae from Cantilever Point, a site that experiences a significant influx of low salinity waters from the Fraser River several times during the summer months. Greater expression of a high molecular weight protein (&gt;300kDa) was observed for eggs produced by females from Cantilever Point than for eggs produced by females from Snug Harbor. Larvae from both locations expressed this high molecular weight protein. Larvae from the two locations differed in mid-range to low molecular weight proteins. The High molecular weight proteins might be a kind of ATPase pump, while the low to intermediate size proteins might be used for cell signaling or heat shock proteins that will help protein folding during stressful events of low salinity","4317":"The literature on paleontology and functional morphology both include many studies on the feeding mechanics of organisms. In extinct organisms, physiological data must be inferred from bone structure, or muscles scars, even in the most exceptionally preserved specimens (Benton, 2010). However even reconstruction and analysis of muscle scars in fossils rely heavily on assumptions (Rieppel, 2002). Given the resilient nature of enamel, teeth are often the most commonly found remains of extinct organisms, and in some cases they are only known remains (Adnet et al., 2009; Pol, 2012). Enamel is highly calcified and so, unlike other softer portions of an organism\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s anatomy, is readily preserved (Lucas et al., 2008). Fortunately, there is a close relationship between tooth form and function, which allows researchers to infer the ecology of the extinct organisms. Slender, pointed teeth, are ideal for puncturing, and bladed teeth are best suited for tearing and cutting prey, whereas more rounded and blunt teeth are thought to function better in crushing prey (Massare, 1987), a feeding strategy termed durophagy. Durophagous predators typically have robust jaw bones in addition to their distinctive and molariform teeth on the premaxilla, maxilla, dentary or the pharyngeal (Norton, 1988, Wilga and Motta, 2000). It is thought that this molariform tooth morphology, as well as tooth arrangement, may serve to increase tooth surface area, thus reducing the stress applied to teeth (Ramsay and Wilga, 2007) when crushing. Studies on the functional ability and structure of durophagous teeth have focused on a range of both extinct and extant organisms, including borophagines canids, early hominoids, and elasmobranchs (Lee et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2008; Tseng ZJ and Wang X, 2010). For these groups, tooth form dictates diet and, by extension, habitat selection and population ecology. From there it is possible to study large-scale evolutionary patterns, co-evolutions, and trophic interactions (Lauten 2013). To understand the relationship between form and function in the teeth of extinct organisms, physical models can be constructed to test the limitations of these structures either through fossil re-creation or inference from testing on extant relatives. Single cusped mammalian teeth (Lee et al., 2011), flat surfaces of the labially compressed bamboo shark teeth (Shimada et al., 2009), and teeth with varying concavities representative of eels (Crofts and Summers, 2014), have all been created and tested on an individual basis. These studies found that a single concave tooth required more force to fracture prey than a convex tooth, and Lee et al. (2011) found that a domed tooth surface works well to strengthen the overall tooth structure. However, Ramseys and Wilga (2007) posit that many teeth contacting prey simultaneously could be vital for durophagy, since multiple contact points will serve to spread bite force over a larger surface area. Most modelling studies, to date, focus on the functional morphology of a single tooth, not the effects of multiple teeth on a prey item. While there are a number of durophagous lineages, all specialized on the same hard-prey consuming life-style, the arrangement of teeth varies between species. For example, ancient durophagous elasmobranchs such as Ptychodus occidentalis exhibit cusped teeth of the dentary premaxilla and maxilla in rows similar to modern carnivorous sharks (Shimada et al., 2009). In contrast, Megapiranah paranensis, an extinct Serrasalmid, has a staggered, zig-zag dentition on the oral jaws (Grubich et al., 2012). Some durophagous teleost fishes have completely skipped the oral jaws and use flattened pharyngeal tooth plates for crushing (Hernandez and Motta, 1997). Similarly the extinct marine Sauropterygians, the Placodonts, also evolved tooth plates, but on completely different bones. Those goals of this study are: (i) to determine how tooth arrangement affects the ability to crush a simplified prey item, (ii) to test if and how the effects of tooth arrangement vary with tooth occlusal morphology, and (iii) to determine if crushing idealized prey items is a feasible proxy for natural prey items.","4318":"The Northern Clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus, has many well-studied morphological adaptations to help it cope with the harsh environment that it lives in: the intertidal zone. Lab studies have shown that this fish can adhere to smooth and rough surfaces as well as slippery and non-slippery surfaces. Now, the aim of the current study is to define the habitat of the Northern Clingfish and compare habitat parameters with these previous lab studies. We show that the clingfish is presented with a challenging, slippery habitat We find that nearly 90% of the rocks present in the habitat of the clingfish are covered in biofilm and are consequently slippery. Clingfish cope with their habitat by seeking shelter under rocks within a specific size range (15-45 cm in width) and they are most commonly found under rocks that have gravel as the main substrate. Rocks that clingfish were found under possessed a wide range of aufwuchs (periphyton) cover. Rock size did not correlate to fish length, but a bimodal distribution was found in the transect area.","4319":"Sexual selection involves a complex interplay between intrasexual selection and intersexual selection in which choice and competition converge to maximize reproductive fitness. Our study examines these selective forces in the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, an earwig species in which both females and males possess weaponry. Forceps asymmetry has been noted as a competitive advantage in size-matched small male maritime earwigs and was examined as a factor determining sexual selection along with body size. We examined the roles of these two factors, body size and forceps asymmetry, as it relates to four types of sexual selection; female choice, male choice, male competition, and female competition. We limited the movement of certain earwigs while allowing others to move freely within artificial arenas to examine choice and competition. Our results revealed strong sexual selection for larger sizes through both competition and choice, but there was no preference based on forceps asymmetry. We found significant results in all four trial types, including not only the more traditional male competition and female choice, but also female competition and male choice. However, competition trials yielded our most compelling results. This complex, multidimensional mating system is likely driven by competitive forces and highly influenced by factors determining dominance in intraspecific competition.","4320":"Understanding recent eelgrass declines in San Juan County is of vital importance, as these eelgrass communities represent incredible ecological and economic value. The alarming magnitude of these losses and the unlikelihood of natural recolonization are additional reasons to continue exploring factors that may have contributed to decline. This project addressed one of the least studied vehicles for coastal pollution as a potential contributor to eelgrass loss: submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). SGD can introduce potent pollutants such as nutrients and herbicides directly to nearshore ecosystems. The goal of this project was to determine whether SGD is affecting eelgrass health in San Juan Island National Historical Park sites by adding excess nitrogen or phosphorous to waters at these sites. While no phosphate loading was detected, elevated nitrogen concentrations were observed both in seawater samples, at approximately 1 mg\/L, as well as in SGD samples at 1-2 mg\/L nitrogen. Roche Harbor, on the north side of the island showed the highest concentrations at 2.1 mg\/L. Considering the harmful effects of nitrogen loading on eelgrass, it seems that SGD may have a negative effect on local eelgrass habitats.","4321":"By studying variation in feeding apparatus morphology across similar sympatric species, we can better understand the evolutionary relationships and ecological niches of these species. The most common feeding technique among vertebrates is suction feeding, in which an animal rapidly expands its buccal cavity to create negative pressure and suck in prey. Suction feeders not only open their jaws quickly; they must also close them rapidly to prevent elusive prey from escaping. In this study, we compared jaw morphology and feeding kinematics of five species of Salish Sea sculpin. We used anatomical dissection to measure differences in jaw adductor morphology and jaw leverage, and we used Sonometric crystal implantation to measure gape change and muscle strain during feeding. Although we found high conservation of body length to muscle mass ratio among species, visual inspection of the head and jaw revealed important differences. We found that the red Irish lord (Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus) possessed the fastest jaw, as demonstrated by anatomical measurement of a small lever ratio, kinematic measurement of a large gape-change to muscle-strain ratio, and behavioral observation of the red Irish lord\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ambush hunting strategy. This study highlights the importance of including behavior and ecology in analyses of organismal morphology.","4322":"Particle size distribution is a key physical factor in determining where organisms live in sedimentary marine habitats because it strongly influences the mechanical properties of the medium and thus the energy required to move through it. We examined burying efficiency in and preference among five natural sediments for two crab species \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Metacarcinus magister (the Dungeness crab), a habitat specialist and Cancer productus (the red rock crab), a habitat generalist. Crab burial speeds and sediment stiffnesses were measured at five field sites. Dungeness crabs buried equally well in less stiff, well-sorted sands and more stiff, poorly-sorted mud\/cobble mixtures. At all sites they buried more quickly than red rock crabs whose performance decreased with increasing heterogeneity of the sediment. These results are contrary to expectations based on reported habitat specificity of the two species. Burial speed decreased with increasing carapace size especially for red rock crabs. The burial success and speed of Dungeness crabs is associated with the relatively larger surface area of their propoduses and the sharper angle formed by the posterior border of the carapace and abdomen. In replicate mesocosms, crabs explored five substrates and then buried in one. Dungeness crabs tended to select well-sorted sediments similar to where we found them in the field. In contrast, red rock crabs were least likely to bury in the mud\/cobble sediment in which they had the most difficulty burying although this sediment was typical of the field site where they were most common. The discrepancies among burial performance, sediment preference, and natural distribution reveal the complexity of habitat use between these co-occurring species and are in contrast to the pattern shown by burying fish and some other crab species.","4323":"Suction feeding is the most common vertebrate feeding mode. Fishes suction feed by rapidly expanding the buccal cavity, creating a subambient pressure inside the mouth that causes water (and, ideally, a prey item) to rush in. The predator\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to close the mouth around evasive prey determines feeding success. As a fish grows, the volume it engulfs should scale with length to the third power (volume \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 length3). This becomes a burden on larger fishes, as muscle force (which drives mouth closing) should scale with length squared (force \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 muscle cross-sectional area \u201a\u00e0\u00f9 length2). Since suction volume increases faster with size than muscle force, a force deficit results as fish grow larger. Two ways to counteract this deficit are to increase muscle mass or increase skeletal leverage within the jaw. In this study, we examined musculoskeletal variation in anatomy and kinematics across an ontogenetic series in the suction-feeding great sculpin, Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. Our results show that great sculpin mandibles change shape as they grow, increasing jaw-closing muscle leverage, which counters the force deficit (N = 6, p = 0.0456). Kinematic results agree: a given amount of muscle strain produces less jaw displacement in larger fish (N = 6, p &gt; 0.00015). We did not find disproportionate changes in muscle mass with size (N = 7, p=.514). Smaller fish, therefore, rely on high-velocity jaw closing whereas larger fish rely more on high forces to close the jaw. We hypothesize that a smaller fish needs high speed to reduce the risk of prey escape from a small suction volume, whereas a large fish needs high forces to move the disproportionately large volume of water.","4324":"A variety of species are known to sense and respond to the geomagnetic field for navigation. The sea slug Tritonia tetraquetra (a.k.a. Tritonia diomedea) has been shown to respond to the magnetic field through both behavior and electrophysiological experiments. However, it remains unclear by which mechanism this sensory information is integrated into motor commands. Additionally, the purpose for a response to magnetic stimuli has yet to be determined. While it is hypothesized that the sea slug sometimes uses a cue-switching mechanism to navigate, ultimately relying on the magnetic field for orientation, laboratory experiments thus far have failed to demonstrate this behavior. The experiments here sought to test this cue-switching hypothesis by demonstrating a response to a local distortion in the geomagnetic field. However, the behavioral response observed was an increased turning frequency upon loss of an initial attractive odor, independent of magnetic distortion, which is inconsistent with the hypothesized straight, geomagnetic-guided crawling. Additionally, in electrophysiological experiments ciliary motor neurons Pd5 and Pd6, as well as sensory nerve CeN1, failed to demonstrate a response to rotations of the magnetic field, despite previous evidence that these units are involved in T. tetraquetra\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s magnetic response. These results, when compared with previously demonstrated responses, may imply conditional parameters under which detection and use of the magnetic field are employed, or may be due to population differences.","4325":"Seagrasses are facing a global population decline and bottom cover has grown sparser in many locations. Garrison Bay, in the San Juan Archipelago, was the site of a complete loss of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in 2003, and no recovery has occurred. Although the exact cause of the disappearance is unknown, one possible factor is nitrate loading caused by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). This study was divided into two parts in order to investigate the causative factors behind the disappearance. First a field component focused on identifying SGD sites and determining the concentration of nitrate in the discharge. Second, in a mesocosm study Z. marina was exposed to ambient, 2X ambient, or 5X ambient concentrations of nitrate. Three SGD sites were identified, with the site in a highly modified area (the site of a hotel and marina established in 1886) containing elevated levels of nitrate. Eelgrass grown in mesocosms was exposed to increased nitrate concentrations (2X and 5X) introduced into the water column. Although shoot growth differences were not significant, there was a significant difference in the total number of lesions, associated with the marine pathogen Labyrinthula zosterae, found in each treatment with the fewest lesions in the 5X ambient nitrate concentration and 180% more lesios in the 2X ambient nitrate concentration. This finding may indicate that while growth differences between treatments were not statistically significant, the 5X nitrate treatment may have decreseased the spread of Labyrinthula zosterae along shoots.","4326":"The transport system of cheilostome bryozoans is unusual among long-distance transport systems. In these colonial animals, a network of strands (the funicular system) carries nutrients to non-feeding individuals and to the growing edge of the colony. However a complex of cells appears to plug the pores that connect individuals. Focusing on the cheilostome, Membranipora membranacea, we used time lapse movies to test whether there were contractions\/dilations of funicular strands, as expected if muscular pumping were to move material through the strands, and to test whether cells or large vesicles moved directionally along the strands, potentially carrying nutrients. Neither contractions\/dilations of the funicular strands, nor persistent movement of particles or other features along the strands, were visible in time lapse videos (10 to 120 min at 4 to 10 sec per frame). The only visible movements were rare back-and-forth movements along the strands, or shaking of the strands. We injected materials that differed in molecular\/particle size to investigate the specificity of transport at pore plates. Both fluorescein (367 Da; as sodium salt) and fluorescein-dextran (70,000 Da) moved between individuals; however 2.0\u0152\u00bam fluorescent polystyrene beads did not. The fact that both fluorescein and fluorescein-dextran were transported suggests that transmembrane channel or transporter proteins are not required for transport; however there may be an upper size limit (&lt;2\u0152\u00bam) caused by something other than the pore itself. Our results are consistent with some transport mechanisms (e.g. paracellular diffusion or transcytosis at the pore plate) but inconsistent with others (muscularly-pumped flow along funicular strands, cell crawling, or transmembrane transport via transporter or channel proteins).","4327":"Dam removal is an emerging technique for ecosystem management. Reservoirs behind the dams are known to be both carbon sinks and sources. The Elwha dam removals in Washington State are the largest dam removals in U.S. history. In this study the fate of the carbon stored in the reservoirs upon its abrupt release is evaluated. Sediment samples from the estuary, delta and water column were tested for their particulate organic carbon content through loss-on-ignition testing. Grain sizes of sediment samples were analyzed and volume estimates of carbon deposits were calculated. The results indicated that particulate organic carbon was preferentially deposited in two locations. The large woody debris typically settled on the subaerial delta, while the carbon sorbed to silt and clay settled in the estuary and subaqueous delta. The sudden release of the reservoirs resulted in a condition where river meandering through the former reservoir beds is minimal. As a result, approximately half of the carbon likely sorbed to the sediment in the reservoirs remains. The rapid sediment accumulation resulted in a higher-than-average carbon burial rate of the roughly 165,000 +\/- 124,000 tonnes of carbon deposited on the delta. This suggests dam removal can not only restore an ecosystem and may also be able to help mitigate climate change.","4328":"For almost 100 years sediment has been building up behind two dams on the Elwha River in Washington State (Warrick et al., 2009). It was determined that in order to restore the watershed, the most effective process would be the removal of the dams (Gelfenbaum et al., 2009). This study looks at the effects of the increased sediment budget on comparative grain-size and topographical and bathymetry profiles of two transect lines, east and west of the Elwha River mouth. We found a higher accumulation of sediment on the East transect versus the West transect which is likely due to the oblique wave angle on the delta and net alongshore transport to the east. The morphology of the East transect line after dam removal changed to a steeper slope which could be caused from the increased sediment being deposited faster than it can be eroded. Lastly, we found that the beach substrate within the troughs on the subaerial delta was finer while the berms consisted of coarser material, which is likely due to the relative exposure to wave energy.","4329":"Dam removals induce large scale disturbances to a system, having wide-spread impacts on the physical and biological characteristics of the rivers and coastal waters downstream. Removal of two large dams on the Elwha River, Washingtion has resulted in increases in sediment delivery to the Elwha delta affecting substrate composition and biological communities. Pre-dam removal monitoring has characterized substrate and community composition but uncertainties on the extent of deposition and resulting community responses to increased deposition remain. The relationship between acoustic backscatter of the seabed, seafloor substrate, and macrofaunal habitat was examined using sidescan sonar data and physical grab samples taken on the Elwha delta. Backscatter intensity analysis was combined with grain-size distribution allowing for classification of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2suitable\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 versus \u201a\u00c4\u00f2probably suitable\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 habitat. Habitat suitability pre and post dam removal was determined based on shifts in substrate on the subaqueous delta following dam removal. Acoustic backscatter results suggest an increase in fine-grain sediment, increasing the area of unsuitable habitat by 0.7 km2 since pre-dam removal conditions. Physical grab samples taken pre-dam removal reveal seafloor substrate was composed of primarily of gravel and sand, whereas post-dam removal conditions to date were characterized by sand and mud. Grain-size analysis from 2014 suggests a continuation of the shift toward fine-grained sediment. In the short-term it appears sediment supply in post-dam removal conditions is high enough to support the accumulation of mud on the delta, modifying the seafloor substrate and likely resulting in loss of kelp habitat. Whether these trends persist and kelp is permanently displaced remains unknown.","4330":"Dam construction on rivers like the Elwha River in Washington State reduces sediment supply to adjacent coastal systems and has often been linked to coastal erosion and threats to human infrastructure. With the removal of two dams on the Elwha River, it was hypothesized that chronic erosion of the surrounding coastline would slow or reverse. To test the impact of dam placement and removal on shoreline change, shoreline change was quantified by digitizing shoreline position using a 1908 survey map and four aerial photographs spanning 1939-2014. Anthropogenic and natural features related to shoreline change were identified using a combination of aerial photographs, remotely-sensed data and field surveys. Shoreline change analysis revealed retreat of the vegetation line east of the river mouth both before and during dam removal and areas of net accretion to the west. However, for ~1 km east of the river mouth during dam removal, new sediment accreted along the shoreline where vegetation retreated. Although this indicates that in some places movement of the vegetation line is not a reliable proxy for shoreline change, it also reveals that dam removal has not slowed erosion in all areas of the eastern coastline. Local wave regimes and the locations of abandoned river channels, levees, and shoreline armoring correlate spatially with calculated patterns of shoreline change. This suggests the importance of considering all of the potential geologic and anthropogenic influences when predicting shoreline responses to major disturbances such as dam removal.","4331":"Small mountainous rivers, such as the Elwha River in Washington State, play a key role in the sedimentary processes that form and maintain the structure and function of their neighboring shorelines. The Elwha River was dammed from 1910 to 2011, and construction of the dams has been attributed to coarsening and erosion of its delta and adjacent shorelines. In turn, the habitat made available to marine organisms was altered for nearly 100 years. This study examined the median (D50) of the grain sizes, sand fractions, and respective elevations of physical samples from the Elwha delta using dry and wet sieve methods, as well as average surface grain sizes using photographic methods, to evaluate the impacts of dam removal of the restoration and\/or expansion of Pacific sand lance (sand lance) spawning habitat. Of the 34 physical samples collected and as of 12 and 13 April 2014, the findings suggest 10 sample locations west and 8 samples locations east of the river mouth met the three parameters documented as preferred sand lance spawning habitat. Each of the 18 locations within the study area had grain-size distributions with medians ranging between ~0.2 and 2.0 mm, the bulk sand fractions of each sample ranged between ~60 and 98%, and their respective elevations were between +1.33 and +2.22 m MLLW. Potentially suitable spawning habitat for sand lance was found ~1,230 m west and ~1,500 m east of the river mouth.","4332":"River plumes are a form of sediment transport from the river to the sea. In the Elwha River, Washington, suspended sediment forms a river plume that is released into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Here, we evaluate the suspended-sediment concentration in water-column profiles and sensor calibration to determine the location of the plume in the Strait. The results suggest that in general, suspended-sediment concentrations were higher on the west side of the delta than to the east side, and a bottom plume was observed in the east. Based on changes in salinity and tides, we suggest that tides control the movement of suspended sediment in the vicinity of the Elwha River mouth, and that low salinity and suspended-sediment concentration are correlated.","4333":"The Elwha River on Washington State\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Olympic Peninsula was home to two dams for almost a century. Dam removal began in 2011, releasing sediment into the Elwha River, forming a pronounced river plume. It is important to evaluate the response of the river ecosystem to such a drastic change. We examined light attenuation associated with the plume, using photosynthetically-active radiation measurements along with suspended sediment concentrations. Results suggest that there is not enough light penetrating depths of 5 m for successful primary production of some species. Suspended sediment in the water column prohibits light penetration &gt; 10% water depth. As a result, the habitat of Z. marina, a local sea-grass species requiring a minimum of 18.6% light penetration, is likely affected. Based on suspended sediment concentrations in the water and the available light, it is hypothesized that Z. marina needs to grow at shallower depths away from the river plume in order to receive sufficient light in the Elwha delta.","4334":"River dam removals are a form of sediment supply to the sub-tidal areas near river mouths. Suspended sediment in the sub-tidal water column can attenuate light, decreasing the amount of light available to seabed photosynthesizers, but not much is known about the effects of sediment plume light attenuation on kelp growth. During a recent dam removal project on the Elwha River, kelp densities in the sub-tidal region declined. In this study we evaluate trends in kelp growth since dam removal on the Elwha River began, using dive surveys from 2010 to 2013, and relate these trends to long-term river turbidity and light intensity data obtained during a 3-day study period in April 2014. The results suggest that the river plume attenuates light and has been at least partially responsible for decreases in kelp densities, but that this is not the sole determining factor in kelp growth. Another factor hypothesized to influence kelp growth is a difference in substrate size on either side of the river mouth.","4335":"This study investigated Seastar Wasting Disease (SWD) in both Pycnopodia helianthoides and Pisaster ochraceus, involving field surveying, diet, temperature and salinity experiments. SWD describes a set of symptoms that has been seen in sea stars and it is most easily recognized by the presence of white lesions, tissue deterioration and eventually death. The pathogen and disease mechanism is still poorly understood and there have been scattered incidences of SWD reported for the last 50 years, however the current epizooitic has persisted for nearly a year, and has afflicted sea stars on over 3000 miles of coastline. Our study showed that increasing water temperature and decreasing salinity both independently correlate with increasing rates of symptoms appearing on Pycnopodia helianthoides. Field surveying of Pisaster displayed a strong correlation between temperature at the field site and percentage of sea stars showing lesions. Prevalence of SWD increases with seasonally warming temperatures and it is imperative to explore the mechanisms of this relationship and what ecological implications this entails.","4336":"This study explored the relationship that flow in Nereocystis luetkeana beds has to zooplankton communities in the San Juan Islands. The hypothesis was that current flow rates would decrease further inside a kelp bed and that this would affect the types and densities of zooplankton. More Calanoid copepods were expected outside of the beds and more larval organisms inside the beds. Flow rates were measured by attaching blocks that dissolve over time to kelp at the center, edge and outside the kelp bed and comparing the changes in weight. Zooplankton sampling was done with a water pump and net. Results were statistically inconclusive due to small sample size and difficulty in retrieving blocks. There were possible connections between the rate of flow and the differences in zooplankton communities in and out of kelp beds at different sites. Lower velocity sites appear to have more different communities in and out.","4337":"This study investigates sea star wasting disease seen in ecologically important predatory sea stars on intertidal coasts of San Juan Island, Lopez Island and Orcas Island (Washington, United States). Three experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of diet, temperature, salinity on the vulnerability of sea stars to wasting disease. To test the hypothesis that higher pathogen-dosed food would result in heightened infection intensities and also different diet types would result in different infection intensities, we fed Pycnopodia helianthoides with healthy and pathogen-dosed clams and mussels separately. There is no significant difference in either different diet types or in different pathogen-dosed levels treatments to the prevalence of sea star wasting disease. To test the hypothesis that temperature influences the prevalence of sea star wasting disease, we kept P. helianthoides in normal temperature tanks and higher temperature tanks. The prevalence of sea star wasting disease was always higher in warmer temperature treatments. To test the hypothesis that lower salinity environment would lead to higher prevalence of sea star wasting disease, we kept P. helianthoides under normal and lower salinity treatments. More symptomatic sea stars were found in the lower salinity experiment group. Furthermore, disease effects showed seasonal changes in field surveys. Compared with survey data from last winter, sea stars showed higher prevalence of disease in late spring.","4338":"Light plays an important role in kelp ecology as an energy source and as an important kelp growth regulator. It induces a negative phototropic response in kelp haptera. Because longer wavelengths of light are available at shallower depths in additions to shorter wavelengths, it was hypothesized that kelp species generally inhabiting shallower water (e.g., Alaria marginata) would have a phototropic response to red (720-740 nm), green (520-540 nm), and blue (420-440 nm) light. Species generally inhabiting deeper water (e.g., Agarum fimbriatum) would have a stronger negative phototropic response in the blue wavelength of the light in comparison to A. marginata and other color treatments. Kelp haptera were isolated and exposed to unidirectional red, green, and blue light for 16 days. Controls were exposed to unidirectional sunlight or no light. The hypothesis was mostly confirmed. The blue light exposure showed the highest phototropic response in both species, but a higher relative response in A. fimbriatum. Alaria marginata haptera responded to all wavelengths of light. Green exposure produced the lowest response in all species Moreover, it was discovered that red light was responsible for greater growth of haptera in A. marginata than other treatments colors. The mechanism and ecological implications of red light-driven hapteral growth are opportunities for further research.","4339":"This study analyzes the diets of Lontra canadensis populations on San Juan Island, Washington. It tests the hypothesis that the majority of river otter diets, in the populations studied, is composed of fish and crustacean species. Sixty scat samples were collected from two latrine sites in differing environments, and sorted through for remaining hard prey fragments. Fish and crustaceans were the overwhelming majority of otter prey found at each site. However, crustaceans made up a greater proportion of the diets of L. canadensis foraging in the sheltered harbor site than those hunting at the wave-exposed point. This study acts as a starting point for future river otter diet analysis in the San Juan Archipelago, an area not previously studied.","4340":"Beach ecosystems rely on the supply of off-site primary production in the form of stranded algae, or beach wrack. As beach wrack washes up on shore, it is colonized by a host of microbes, detrivores and herbivores, which supply the beach ecosystem food web. This study seeks to understand how nutrients are transferred from seaweed throughout the food web by looking at how mass loss changes in beach wrack as larger invertebrates are included or excluded from the system. We found more total colonizers of beach wrack in treatments that included larger invertebrates. The community structure of colonizers shifted with site, and in treatments that included large amphipods there was more mass loss of algae due to herbivory. In wrack with more ephydridae larvae, mass loss was more uniform between treatments. This shows that the community dynamics of beach wrack colonizers affect how it is degraded, and that the presence of large herbivores like amphipods contributes to the degradation of wrack and thus its integration into the beach ecosystem food web.","4341":"Mussels are filter feeders living and thriving in the harsh conditions of the intertidal environment. Many factors attribute to their success including aggregating in groups, hard shells, but more specifically their ability to strongly attach themselves to substrate with byssal threads. Byssus is a proteinaceous fiber excreted by the byssal foot of a mussel for attachment. It is important to understand the energy distribution Mytilus trossulus, by investigating the energetic cost of byssus production. In this study we manipulate M. trossulus into producing different amounts of byssus among three treatments over a thirty-day experiment. Three byssal removal regiments: those cut daily, those cut weekly, and those never cut, were measured and analyzed for comparisons in metric growth. The mussels with byssal threads being cut daily showed the lowest percent increases in shell length, height, width, and weight among the three treatment groups.","4342":"Algal subsidies are extremely important to the success of the deep benthos where there is little to no primary productivity. Little research has been done on the nutritional value of detritus, such as pieces of kelp, sinking into deep habitats. Sea urchin feces, in the form of detritus, may provide an energetic link to benthic communities with no primary productivity. Urchins are known to have an inefficient digestive system which leaves the potential for high food value in feces. I conducted a series of tests on the relative caloric contents of algae and urchin feces. First, I measured the biomass consumed and egested by urchins. Secondly, I quantified the caloric content of aged and fresh feces of 10 urchins fed diets of either Nereocystis luetkeana or Saccharina latissima. For both kelp diets, the caloric content of algal material increased after being consumed by urchins, and the longer the urchin feces aged, the higher the caloric value became. This could be significant in considering the importance of urchins as a link to benthic communities that rely heavily on detritus for their success.","4343":"Primary productivity does not occur in deeper waters due to limiting light availability, and thus deep subtidal organisms receive energy in the form of detritus. Urchins in the San Juan Archipelago catch and consume large quantities of kelp detritus, and due to inefficient digestive systems their feces have high caloric value and are readily available to benthic organisms. The nutritional value of fresh Nereocystis luetkeana and Saccharina latissima were compared to that of feces from urchins fed the same algal species in a set of population growth and dietary preference experiments using the copepod species Tigriopus californicus. Population growth rates were not recorded due to massive mortalities; however, significant copepod preference for urchin feces over both algal species was observed. This suggests urchins may provide a substantial link between shallow habitats of high algal productivity and deeper subtidal environments of low productivity by providing detritus in the form of high nutrient fecal matter.","4344":"Lontra canadensis, the river otter, is a predator in marine nearshore ecosystems in North America. Because it is a top carnivore, L. canadensis, may be exerting a trophic cascade. Its diet can vary regionally and possibly seasonally. This study examines the diet of L. canadensis through feces analysis from two sites on San Juan Island, WA. Fishes and crustaceans were found to be the main prey items, and there was evidence that relative proportions of different prey types differ with location.","4345":"I investigated the affect of ontogeny on the structure and function of pre-opercular spines. By measuring how these spines matched up against the standard length of the animal. Spines were surgically removed from Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus and put through puncture tests to measure the required force to puncture a ratio of the spine length. We found that spine length grows isometrically to standard length and force to puncture showed a negative allometry. Meaning that larger individuals had the same size spine to body length ratio but the larger spines is more efficient at puncturing. To assess the structure Finite Elemental Analysis techniques were applied to three different size classes of spines. This analysis showed that smaller spines concentrate the Von Mises stress at the tip while the largest sine dissipates this stress down the dorsal medial ridge. The smallest class of spine also showed a much higher Von Mises stress than the larger spine.","4346":"Acellular bone in more derived fishes has been observed withstanding higher stain rates than cellular bones in mammals. The fracture energy of a material can be calculated using an impact test. The opercles the great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were dissected, cut into uniform sizes with a laser, and subjected to a Chapry Impact test. The cross sectional areas of broken samples were used to calculate the fracture energy of the material. The mean of the nobone trials was 0.8124 m with a standard deviation of 0.00176. . Maximum and minimum values for fracture energy of acellular bone were 2877.63 J\/cm2 and 1940.308 J\/cm2, respectively. Maximum and minimum values for fracture energy of cellular were 2643.25 J\/cm2 and 1663.49 J\/cm2, respectively. The fracture energies of the acellular and cellular bone were not significantly different (p=0.3483).","4347":"Many species of elongate fishes use Anguilliform swimming to propel themselves through the water (Gillis 1996, Long 1998). A fish using this method passes a wave of motion from the head, through the body, to the tail causing thrust. This type of swimming is the only one in which the entire body is used as opposed to just the caudal end such as in Thunniform swimmers (Tytell 2010). When watching certain species of elongate fishes swim, an interesting rotation in the body can be observed. If the fish is being looked at dorsally as it swims, there is a clear view of the lateral side of the fish as the tail beats back and forth. This view changes as the fish passes the wave from its head to its tail. The current work will describe a new method for measuring this rotation, or wobble, in the fish as it is swimming.","4348":"Durophagous animals are equipped with myriad morphological adaptations for consuming durable prey. Convergent traits for processing hard prey generally include robust feeding musculature, cyclical loading patterns for crushing biological composites, reinforced skeletons, and an array of specialized tooth designs (Van Valkenburgh 1988; Summers, 2000; Summers et al., 2003; Huber et al., 2005). Molariform teeth are well-known in mammals, but cusped and even concave tooth shapes are present in durophagous taxa (Erickson et al. 2012; Crofts and Summers, 2014). In some durophagous stingrays (Family Myliobatidae), the teeth are fused, forming paired (upper and lower jaw) occlusal surfaces. Individual teeth interlock to form this tooth module. As in other elasmobranchs, teeth in these rays are conveyed anteriorly (or labially) as they wear and are eventually shed (Reif et al., 1978). These myliobatid stingrays include the eagle (Aetobatinae), bat (Myliobatinae), cownose (Rhinopterinae), and devil (Mobulinae) rays (Aschliman et al., 2012; Aschliman, 2014). These rays generally prey on bivalves, gastropods, and crustaceans while planktivory in mobulines is considered a derived trait (Ajemian &amp; Powers, 2012; Ajemian et al. 2012; Adnet et al., 2012; Aschliman, 2014).","4349":"Burial is an understudied behavior among flatfish species. This study aims to understand the role of undulations in flatfish burial. Five species of flatfish were filmed using high speed video cameras to assess the speed of the undulations and determine the amount of sand covering the animal after completing burial. A physical model was also built to test the effect of undulation speed on burial. The results of the physical model suggest that increased speed increases the surface area of sand on the burying object; however this benefit has diminishing returns at high speeds. The live animals suggest that undulations are not the only factor involved in flatfish burial. The posterior portion of the dorsal and anal fins may contribute to burial efficiency in these species.","4350":"Previous research has shown little effect of tooth shape on puncturing ability (Whitenack &amp; Motta, 2010), and though the concept of shark teeth as a saw blade has been explored, it has not been manifested beyond mathematical models and hypotheses (Frazzetta, 1988). Frazzetta\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s analysis covered many aspects of shark teeth in the context of sawing but lacks physical data of their effect when applied. Thus, this project set out to answer several questions about efficiency of shark teeth at sawing prey items: effect of tooth morphology on sawing efficiency, which varied strongly by species; sawing efficiency by trial, to test whether or not teeth are designed for a single use; and, in concept, to see if I can extrapolate feeding ecology from these factors.","4351":"Flatfishes (Actinopterygii: Pleuronectiformes) are a diverse group of teleost fishes, with over 700 species in the order. Jaw asymmetry and diet have been thought to contribute to flatfish diversity but this has not yet been tested in a comparative framework. Here I use geometric morphometric and comparative methods to test whether ocular-blind side asymmetry in flatfish head morphology contributed to flatfish diversification. I find that the repeated convergent evolution of similar morphology, jaw function, and diet likely contribute to the high diversity of flatfishes.","4352":"The family of the Agonidae is characterized by the presence of modified bony scales that form a protecting armor against predators. Despite some very intensive research concerning the skeletal cranial and postcranial anatomy of different Agonids, little information is available in the literature concerning the morphology of these bony scales. In this paper, three common species of the Northeastern Pacific Ocean are microscopically (both stereo and scanning electron microscopy) investigated to show that these bony plates are (a) morphologically different from regular fish scales, (ii) build for strength but also for minimizing the weight of the armor plates and (iii) morphologically different between different species.","4353":"Shark\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ventilation has long been characterised by a two-pump model, where the water coming from the spiracle and the mouth is released by the gill slits after the breathing process. This movement is created by the difference of pressure between the oro-branchial cavity and the parabranchial cavity, consisting of five gill pouches. In an attempt to compare the actual flow velocity coming from each of these five gill openings, experiments have been made on seven individuals of spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi. External measurements have been taken, revealing important differences between the fifth gill slit and the four others, in term of vertical length and width. Also, the introduction of dyed water just above the spiracle has revealed the utilisation of the four first slits. A particle image velocimetry analysis have confirmed the weak flow coming from this last slit. It has also exposed the possibility of the fourth slit\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s flow being less than the flow coming from the three first gill openings. This could be in relation with their feeding behavior, which mostly consist in suction action. The fifth slit could then be used to discharge water while the shark is feeding on preys.","4354":"Deep-sea fishes are known to have muscles that are higher in water content than their shallow-living relatives. In addition to this watery muscle, some deep-dwelling fishes also have a gelatinous layer either directly below the skin or around the spine. This study investigated the composition and implications of this mysterious gelatinous tissue in one of the planet\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s deepest-living fishes. Gel tissues from eight deep water species were analyzed for water content, ionic composition, and osmolality. Bulk protein, lipid, and carbohydrate assays were also conducted. These analyses do not support the hypotheses that this tissue plays a role in nutrient storage or buoyancy. The gelatinous layer is most obvious in the hadal snailfish Notoliparis kermadecensis, making it an appropriate model organism to investigate gel function. The authors propose that the gelatinous tissue that surrounds the fish\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s muscle may act as an energetically inexpensive method of increasing swimming efficiency. To test this hypothesis, swimming performance in the gelatinous hadal snailfish was compared to swimming performance in the tidal snailfish, Liparis florae, which have similar morphology, but with no subcutaneous gel. Video analyses show that Liparis florae swam more body lengths per second than their hadal counterparts. A robotic snailfish model was also used to analyze the impacts of the gelatinous layer on locomotory performance. The robot swam trials with tails of varying water volume. The model showed higher swimming performance with a water-filled tail than with an empty one. Data from these three analyses suggest that the gelatinous layer may aid hadal snailfish locomotion.","4355":"Colonial hydrozoans are well known for their phenotypic plasticity. Colonies of the Obelia geniculata (Cnidaria:Hydrozoa) maintain distinctly different zooids that are specialized for different tasks. It is not known, however, whether O. geniculata is capable of modulating the relative numbers of these structures in response to environmental conditions. In this study I subject O. geniculata to feeding regimes designed to simulate starvation, food-limited, and abundant-food conditions, and measure the numbers of each zooid type to see if they respond to these treatments.","4356":"Many sea anemones aggregate, including Urticina crassicornis (common name: the Christmas or painted anemone). This species occurs on the docks and shores of the Friday Harbor Laboratories as well as the intertidal zones around San Juan Island, Washington. There are many benefits to grouping behavior, such as protection from predators, and propinquity to other reproductive conspecifics. To test wether U. crassicornis migrates in the direction of conspecifics, two anemones of this species were placed in different sections of a Y-maze. The distance traveled by both anemones was recorded. Urticina crassicornis does move; however the context of that movement is unclear. The results are especially interesting in the context of potentially adaptive behavior of anemones as a phylogenetic group.","4357":"The temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima participates in a facultative symbiosis with two genera of unicellular photosynthetic algae. Under stressful conditions such as increased levels of pCO2, anemones expel their algal symbionts causing the anemones to rely more heavily upon heterotrophic feeding. A heavier reliance on heterotrophic feeding could be accomplished by increasing the density of nematocysts. Anthopleura elegantissima individuals were collected from the Friday Harbor Laboratories shoreline (48\u00ac\u221e 32.7646 N, 123\u00ac\u221e 00.5932 W), Washington in June 2014, and the number of nematocyst per \u0152\u00bag of protein was measured to determine if increasing oceanic pCO2 levels will affect the density of nematocysts. The number of nematocyst per \u0152\u00bag of protein was measured again after 7 days in higher (2200 \u0152\u00baatm) or ambient (700 \u0152\u00baatm) pCO2 conditions. There was no difference in the density of nematocysts between individuals kept in different pCO2 levels.","4358":"The Mollusca radula is an intricate organ composed of several rows of teeth running along a chitinous ribbon. Several studies have looked at radula of gastropods but fewer have looked at the radula of Polyplacophora. An observational study comparing morphological differences between species of Mopalian radula, including Mopalia muscosa, Mopalia lignosa and Mopalia ciliata, was conducted. Observations of light microscopy photographs, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) photographs, tooth impressions and video were performed in order to look at differences among species. The results show some major morphological differences among species, such that M. muscosa had more stout teeth whereas M. lignosa had short and narrow teeth and M. ciliata had long, slender teeth. Until now, the differences among the three species of Mopalia have remained unseen.","4359":"Barnacles are gregarious, suspension-feeding invertebrates. They are found mostly in the intertidal and sub-tidal zones, and densely aggregated to facilitate sexual reproduction by copulation. By living together in dense groups, barnacles can change their local flow environment, potentially altering the behavior or energetics of their neighbors. In this study, I recorded video of small aggregations of the barnacle Balanus glandula and studied whether or not individuals responded to adjacent barnacles in their active feeding behavior by either maintaining synchrony or asynchrony in cirral beating. I found that barnacles do not exhibit any behavior that suggests sensitivity to neighbors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 cirral positions, and that the difference in beating phase between actively feeding individuals follows a periodic function as would be expected when comparing the phase of the two individuals beating independently.","4360":"The relationship between propus size and use of snails as prey in sympatric populations of Hemigrapsus nudus and Hemigrapsus oregonensis was investigated. Propal height and propal width increases with body size in a predictable manner in male and female crabs of both species. Sexual dimorphism of propal height and width relationships in both shore crabs is apparent, but there was no detectible difference in chela size between H. nudus and H. oregonensis. The lack of difference in chela size between sympatric H. nudus and H. oregonensis suggests that there is no character displacement in this trait. Both species of crabs showed a strong feeding preference for the thin-shelled gastropod Lacuna vincta over the thicker shelled Littorina scutulata, likely due to the ease of consumption. There were no differences in snail consumption rates between male and female H. nudus of similar propal heights, mostly due to high feeding variation among individual crabs.","4361":"Many marine mollucs deposit their eggs on the substrate encapsulated in distinctive masses, thereby leaving the egg case and embryos vulnerable to possible predators and pathogens. Although it is apparent that many marine gastropods possess chemical anti-predation mechanisms as an adult, it is not known from many species whether or not these compounds are widespread in the egg masses. This study aims to expand our knowledge of egg mass predation examining the feeding behavior of three species of crab when offered egg mass material from three gastropods local to the San Juan Islands. The study includes the dorid nudibranchs Diaulula sandiegensis and Doris montereyensis and the cephalospidean Haminoea virescens. The results illustrate a clear rejection of the egg masses by all three of the crab species tested, suggesting anti-predation mechanisms in the egg masses for all three species of gastropod.","4362":"The low-intertidal zone marine gastropod, Nucella lamellosa, exhibits remarkable phenotypic plasticity between habitats as close as 100 m from one other. Shells that develop in different environments can display variation in color, banding, shape, sculpture, and thickness, and the most documented explanation for this variation is predator-induced resistance. The snails collected from the beach in front of the Friday Harbor Laboratories are of the thick-shelled variety of N. lamellosa and are known to exhibit a row of teeth within their apertural openings, presumably as a defense against their predator, Cancer productus. I collected 25 of these snails at low tide and took systematic measurements (length, width, weight) to quantify shell size, and I used high resolution images of the apertural openings to measure average tooth height and apertural lengths. I found that, while a majority of the snails (19 out of 25) displayed apertural teeth, there were 5 snails that did not (one snail exhibited drastically different morphology). Of the range of shell lengths I collected (1.03 cm \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 5.84 cm), the largest snail without apertural teeth was 1.93 cm. By comparing shell width and weight to shell length, I determined that there was no significant difference between the way snails with and without apertural teeth developed; both groups showed a significant positive correlation between shell width and weight and shell length. I also found that for those snails with apertural teeth, there was a significant positive correlation between apertural length and apertural tooth height.","4363":"Boating traffic can disturb and negatively affect normal behaviors of marine birds, including foraging. Surveys of seabirds were performed on two vessel routes with different types of boat traffic in the San Juan Islands, Washington. Comparisons of data showed that birds were more abundant on the route taken by the Centennial vessel in the San Juan Channel than on the route taken by the Klahowya vessel in the Washington State Ferries\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 San Juan Interisland route. Seabird species were non-uniformly distributed both between the two vessel routes and within each vessel route. My study was unable to find a correlation between seabird abundance and tidal state, contrary to established literature. Data on flushing behavior suggest that response to disturbance is variable between species, locations, and vessels causing the disturbance.Boating traffic can disturb and negatively affect normal behaviors of marine birds, including foraging.

We completed field surveys during 9-18 August 2014 at False Bay to examine general heron abundance and strike rate success for different habitats, tide phases and heights, and heron group sizes. Total abundance was assessed along with location in the bay, habitat type, water depth, and tide phase and height for each individual. We assessed strike rate success for individuals, noting the five criteria above as well. The results from foraging observations indicated that herons at False Bay had greater strike rate successes behind the tideline and in deeper water, and during higher and flood tides. Such success patterns could relate to prey abundance, size, and profitability. We also found the success rate of individual herons to be greater when foraging alone or in groups of six or more. These success patterns could be due to competition factors, as well as herons using one another as indicators of food availability. Additionally, we found heron abundance and success rate appear inversely related in some cases, which may be related to prey depletion. Congruent with findings from previous studies, this study indicates a correlation between heron foraging success and the aforementioned habitat, tide, water depth, and group features.","4365":"Human induced disturbances affect harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) hauled-out off Yellow Island, WA. Disturbances, in this study, include sailboats, motorboats, wake height, and distance of boats to haul-out sites (0 to 200 m). Harbor seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and regulations set by the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), state that no vessels should approach closer than about 100 m to marine mammals. During our study, we observed 41\/71 boats that passed within 100 m of the harbor seals on their haul-out site. We recorded disturbance behavior of harbor seals as vigilance and flushing and recorded their location on the haul-out site as low, waterline to 1 m, and high as any seals above 1 m. Our results indicate that in general, seals below 1 m are more vigilant. During wake disturbances, we recorded a mean vigilance of about 40.2% as compared to those about 1 m up on the haul-out site with a mean vigilance of 8.6% . Again, seals were more vigilant in low areas when comparing distances of boats to vigilance. Out of all the disturbances (i.e. sailboats, motor boats, and wakes), wakes causes the highest amount of vigilance. Our results indicate that regulations set by the NMFS and MMPA need to be revised; specifically the 100 m distance that vessels are required to avoid approaching marine mammals.","4366":"The dive behavior of the Double Crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and the Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) was studied along Cattle Pass of San Juan Island, WA, USA. Dive durations and resting periods were measured for consecutive, sequential dives of each type of cormorant. Comparing the two species, mean dive time was greater for the Pelagic Cormorant. Both species exhibited dive to rest time ratios greater than one (&gt;1) and therefore generate an oxygen debt that must be resupplied after completion of dive bouts. Tidal phase, including tidal height and current speed had an effect on when both species chose to forage. Further analysis of prey abundance and final resting locations in the Cattle Pass region are needed to understand more about the Double Crested and the Pelagic Cormorant\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s dive behavior in the San Juan channel.","4367":"Knowing if rates of vigilance between mother harbor seals and lone adults (Phoca Vitulina) differ in any way is essential in moving conservation efforts in the right direction. We used focal individual and scan samples of harbor seals off of Yellow Island, WA to examine any possible differences in vigilance between the two seal categories at low tides. The result of overall vigilance rates for the seals was inconclusive. However, we did find that mother seals tend to be more vigilant the higher the tide goes, while lone adults had no change. This signifies that the less haul out space available, the more vigilant mothers become. Also, mothers spend less time loafing overall than lone adults and more time swimming, possibly due to the fact they are teaching their young feeding techniques. The data on vigilance rates being relatively equal between the two seal categories is inconsistent with prior studies, possibly due to smaller number of sample days. Overall, this study shows that while vigilance does not change much for mothers, they do spend more time exhibiting other active behaviors and less time resting than lone adults.","4368":"Two studies were conducted at Cattle Pass, Washington between 13-18 August 2014. The first study was conducted to determine the relationship between tidal height and the haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus) at the Whale Rocks of the San Juan Channel. There was a clear diurnal pattern of abundance during both of the days used for data analysis. The abundance was very low in the morning which may be a result of the nighttime\/early morning foraging behavior characteristic of Steller Sea Lions. It was determined that this variation in haul-out abundance of Steller Sea Lions did not occur in response to changes in tidal height. The data also suggest that air temperature may play a role in determining the total abundance of Steller Sea Lions. The second study was done to understand how two unrelated bird species, Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani), compare and contrast in their use of the Cattle Pass rocky intertidal habitat post-breeding season. It was found that Black Oystercatchers spend most of their time loafing in the region while Harlequin Ducks spend most of their time swimming and foraging. These data suggest that Black Oystercatchers use the habitat primarily as a resting area between flock feedings while Harlequin Ducks use it primarily as a feeding ground during molting periods that cause them to be temporarily flightless.","4369":"Marine birds are an excellent indicator of the health of the Salish Sea, located in between British Columbia, Canada and Washington State, United States. There have been research projects conducted in the 1970\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and 1990\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s that revealed a significant decrease in seabird populations in the area. However, these projects only focused on the reduction of seabird populations during the winters. Friday Harbor Laboratories is currently attempting to gather data for the summers. During the summer of 2014, four surveys were conducted in one transect of the San Juan Channel. Results revealed an overwhelming majority of alcids, mainly rhinoceros auklets. Most of the seabirds aggregated near the northern and southern ends of the transect surveyed. Comparing the data to the survey results from 2012 and 2013, 2012 had a much higher density of seabirds than in 2013 and 2014. The community composition of the seabirds in the region remained steady over the three years. There is no apparent trend for the aggregation of birds in certain zones within the transect. There is also no apparent pattern with the number of birds seen in relation to tides or current speed. However, there could be a possible correlation with global weather patterns, suggesting that large number of seabirds can be associated with La Ni\u221a\u00b1a conditions. There is not enough data in the three years of the surveys to confirm any observations.","4370":"A widely distributed species of wood-boring bivalve, Xylophaga washingtona, was collected from three sites along the Washington-Oregon margin and assessed with molecular techniques. 16S gene sequences revealed low differentiation between individuals from the two sites on the outer continental slope suggesting that these sites harbor a single population. However, greater genetic distance was observed between the slope individuals and those collected from a shallow-water site in the San Juan Islands, Washington. These results suggest the presence of at least two distinct populations of Xylophaga washingtona along the Washington-Oregon margin and the potential for species-level differences. The juxtaposition of the two hydrographic settings supports the hypothesis that isolation of the shallow-water population has resulted in sufficient genetic differentiation over fairly short geographic distances. Further research is needed to verify these observed patterns and to explore whether morphological differences support the proposed population and species structure.","4371":"Ephemeral reducing environments such as hydrothermal vents and whale falls create oases of chemosynthetic primary production in the nutrient poor deep sea. The polychaete family Siboglinidae has adapted to occupy these niches of chemical nutrition. This likely requires high levels of dispersal, either through long-living larvae or a \u201a\u00c4\u00fastepping-stone\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 dispersal method. Here we seek to identify recently found specimens of Osedax from whalebones off the coast of Oregon and Antarctica. Once species identity was determined, we sought to elucidate connectivity between known populations of Osedax from Monterey Bay and Sagami Bay. To accomplish this, we sequenced the mitochondrial marker COI and inferred relationships through a haplotype network and maximum likelihood tree.","4372":"Benthic macrofauna are a diverse group of organisms found in both deep-sea and shallow-water systems. Understanding the influence of biotic and abiotic factors in shallow-water systems can translate to further understanding inaccessible deep-sea community structure. This study observes the change in community structure as a function of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Altitude Above Mean Low-tide Sea-level\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 (AAML) and distance from shore through push-core sediment sampling. In addition, this study identifies several specimens through genetic barcoding methods. The results show closer relationship among 90cm AAML sites than between any 90cm and 60cm site. Finally, specimens identified through barcoding could not be identified down to a species level. Future population genetic analyses will benefit from increasing accessibility to metagenetics and high-throughput sequencing.","4373":"Barkley Canyon is a submarine canyon located on the west continental margin of Vancouver Island, British Columbia in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. This area is known for seasonal upwelling, which accounts for lower, temporally varying oxygen levels along the margin at depth. Oxygen concentration data from in situ CTD\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s and video footage, obtained from Ocean Network Canada installations in Barkley Canyon, were used to examine correlations between megafaunal abundance and diversity, and oxygen fluctuations from two sites at Barkley Canyon. The Upper Slope site is located along the slope ridge and at a depth of approximately 400 meters and the Mid-Canyon site is located within the canyon towards the base at approximately 890 meters. There is a decrease in the number of species present at the Mid-Canyon site, in correlation with the decrease in oxygen concentrations. A similar correlation was not observed at the Upper Slope. Oxygen is necessary for most organisms to live, whose importance increases at depths that contain lower oxygen levels than surface waters.","4374":"Wood falls represent a rare and ephemeral, yet important source of food in the deep-sea. Wood-boring bivalves of the family Xylophagainae have high reproduction and growth rates, allowing them to rapidly colonise and exploit these resources. While efforts have focussed on the taxonomy of this group, there has been less research carried out on reproduction and larval recruitment. Specimens of Xylophaga washingtona were collected from an experimental wood deployment placed at a depth of 1, 605 m for 15 months off the coast of Oregon, USA. Individuals were compared using the mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene to test for the presence of multiple cohorts. The analyses revealed genetic differentiation within the population. This suggests that colonisers are arriving in multiple cohorts, as opposed to one single cohort. However, the sample size was extremely low, with poor data quality, and the results of this study should therefore not be considered reliable or conclusive. Future studies on the population genetics of X. washingtona would be valuable in further addressing recruitment of this species.","4375":"Sunken wood in marine environments supports a diverse community, the stars of the show being the wood-boring bivalves. Shallow versus deep-sea woodfalls tend to only attract bivalves from one of two clades; Teredinidae and Xylophagaidae respectively. A recent deployment of experimental wood substrates returned a new form of boring bivalve that has morphological characteristics (mesoplax and lack of viscera in the siphons) indicating it as a xylophagaid, yet has hard pallet-like structures that had previously only been observed in the shallow water teredinids. This study sought to understand the phylogenetic placement of this new taxon (Xylophagaid A) with consideration of the various siphon-associated hard parts that have been described across boring bivalve groups. I sequenced the 18S and 28S rDNA nuclear genes from Xylophagaid A and Xylophaga zierenbergi and aligned these with sequences from Distel et al. (2011) for Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The resulting trees confirm Xylophagaid A as a member of Xylophagaidae and indicate a close relationship to Xyloredo, a genus that has a calcareous tube. Additional taxonomic sampling and closer morphological investigations are required, but this study indicates preliminary evidence for convergence in siphon-associated hard parts in wood-boring bivalves.","4376":"The importance of scavenging communities, and the detritus and carrion on which they feed, has been well studied from the perspectives of spatial food subsidies (marine to terrestrial, terrestrial to marine, and marine to marine) and community structure (e.g. whale and wood falls in the deep sea). Most of these studies focus on comparing scavenging rates or scavenger diversity within a single habitat, usually deep-sea or intertidal, and seldom make comparisons between these regions. A baited trap experiment was conducted to quantify the macro-scavenger community and scavenging rates on aged fish and kelp at intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal sites around San Juan Island, WA, USA. Bray Curtis cluster analysis showed a distinction between macrofaunal communities in the intertidal and both subtidal sites, with higher scavenging rates on fish than kelp at all sites. Differences in the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were found in trap macrofaunal communities between sites, although further study is needed to show if these differences are really the result of different communities of scavengers or merely the influx of ambient macrofauna into the traps at different sites.","4377":"As fisheries grow and the amount of bycatch being thrown back into the oceans rises, studies on the effects of interferences in natural food chain processes that occur throughout the ocean become increasingly important. This study aims to look at scavenging rates at different depths and make preliminary observations about how quickly carrion will be consumed and affect the food chain. Three identical traps were deployed at three different habitats: intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal. The first was pulled up after 6 hours, the second after 12 hours, and the third after 24 hours. All of the species within each trap were counted, identified, recorded, and entered into Primer and Excel to determine the differences between the habitats, the species richness and diversity for each depth, and the percent bait consumption to determine scavenging rates. The results showed that scavenger species varied noticeably at different depths. The shallow subtidal had the highest scavenger diversity and fastest consumption rates. It also seems apparent that scavenging rates in the intertidal are slowest. Therefore, the habitat would probably be most affected by large carrion debris due to slow decomposition, but it would affect upper trophic levels more slowly than in the other habitats. Future studies should be completed at deeper depths, with more replication, and using controls to find more conclusive results.","4378":"A recent outbreak of sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) along the U.S. West coast has decimated populations of many intertidal and subtidal sea star species. If populations are unable to recover quickly, SSWS is likely to cause significant changes to rocky intertidal and subtidal community structure and functioning in the Northeast Pacific ocean. Recovery will likely depend in large part on the success of larval recruitment, but the impacts of SSWS on larvae are unknown. We raised embryos and early stage P. ochraceus larvae in treatments of sea water that varied in filtration exposure to potential pathogens of SSWS. We assessed treatment impacts on larval survival development and larval size. We found a significant effect of water treatment and filtration level on two measures of larval survival. Further studies are needed to better understand the direction and magnitude of these and other effects of SSWS on larval fitness.","4379":"One of the arguments for the persistence of planktonic larval stages in the life cycles of benthic marine invertebrates is that pelagic larvae experience a release from predation when they move off the benthos and into the water column. However, it is difficult to substantiate this hypothesis because we lack comparative data on mortality rates of unprotected (e.g., not in egg capsules or gelatinous masses) embryos and larvae on the benthos and in the water column. The aim of this study was to provide some of this missing information, by comparing development success in benthic and pelagic environments. Dendraster excentricus embryos were placed in enclosed development chambers under three treatment conditions: 1) directly on the substratum (unscreened benthic), 2) on a screen on the substratum (screened benthic), and 3) on a screen raised 3 cm above the substratum (screened pelagic). Development success for pelagic embryos was consistently higher than those on the benthos, substantiating the hypothesis that embryos experience a release from predation as they move off the benthos. In addition, the screened benthic treatment had significantly higher development success than the unscreened benthic treatment, indicating that macro-predators (&gt;55 \u0152\u00bam) may significantly reduce development success for unprotected larvae. Higher development success of protected pelagic treatments may have been due to lower abundances of pelagic micro-predators or anoxic conditions on the benthos.","4380":"The free-spawning species of chitons produce eggs that are enclosed in a capsule known as the hull. Particularly in the group of Chitonida, this outer coat is formed by spine projections. Previous studies have identified the function of the hull as a \"sperm guide\" that facilitates the fertilization of the eggs, and one has suggested that this hull also serves to slow down the sinking rates of the eggs. In this study, I present concrete evidence showing that the hull does reduce the sinking rates of eggs in the chiton species Mopalia ciliata, acting as flotation device, as a consequence of its lower density compared to sea water and the egg without this structure. Additionally, changes during ontogeny in behavior, swimming velocities, and body shape of the larvae of this species were analyzed. Over time, the larvae decrease their tendency to swim up and prefer to stay in the bottom, and the body becomes elongated. These changes may be related to preparation for settle and metamorphosis into a juvenile. This study shows the importance of the hull structure in the sinking rates of the chitons eggs, and the ontogenetic changes in behavior and form that the larvae present, encouraging further studies to evaluate the ecological impact of these aspects in the persistence of the species.","4381":"The larval swimming patterns prior to settlement play an important role in geographic dispersal and genetic connection for sessile marine organisms. This study examined how swimming patterns and size change with age for larvae of the bryozoan, Bugula c.f. californica. We observed three different swimming patterns, including upward swimming, downward swimming, and sinking which were observed every hour post hatch for four hours until the onset of settlement each day. We used analysis of digital photographs to measure the body length and width of larvae within the same cohort. Almost all early stage larvae swam up to the top in the first hour, but in later stages larvae changed their swimming pattern to swim down or sink. Upward velocity averaged at about 2mm per second and decreased over time, and in the fourth hour the larvae started to sink at about 2mm per second. In addition, there is no significant difference among the values of the lengths or widths of the larvae over time, but these phenotypic characteristics did vary within the age cohorts.","4382":"Intertidal organisms face highly variable environments with a multitude of stresses placed on them. Freshwater input from rain and run off is one such stress. Salinity changes have been shown to have adverse developmental effects on embryos of intertidal organisms. Although these organisms have developed different mechanisms by which larvae and embryos cope with stresses, relatively little has been demonstrated on the range of environmental stresses the eggs are able to tolerate. In this study adults and egg masses of the sacogloassan sea slug, Alderia modesta (Lov\u221a\u00a9n 1844), were subjected to acute salinity stress to determine the consequences for reproduction and embryonic development to hatching, respectively. New egg masses that had been laid at constant salinity were exposed to varying salinity (7-37ppt) stress within 12 hours of deposition. Adults were exposed to varying salinity while reproducing and the egg masses they subsequently produced were compared between ambient and experimental conditions. Hatching success of eggs was significantly higher at intermediate salinities, with zero hatching success at the lowest salinity treatment (7ppt), and delayed development with low (10%) success at the highest treatment. When exposed to the same acute salinity stresses, adults did not lay egg masses so no comparative data was collected. These results show tolerance to and development in lower salinity than previous studies, providing evidence that successful reproduction might be less restricted by conditions of embryonic development.","4383":"The relative rates of mortality in benthic and pelagic environments have been proposed as a major factor structuring the evolution of complex benthic invertebrate life histories. Field methods, such as tethering, have provided indispensable measurements of mortality under natural conditions for the larvae of benthic invertebrates. However, few such field studies have examined mortality rates of benthic invertebrates' early life stages in size classes less than 1 mm. Here, we tethered egg capsules to quantify how rates of predation vary with environmental gradients, especially distance from the benthic substratum and flow velocity. We found that predation is consistently high on L. scutulata egg capsules and invariant at four positions in the water column and on the benthic substratum (average 34% loss across all treatments). Instead, the flow environment had the greatest effect on predation rate. We hypothesize that higher predation in the faster flow environment was due to higher encounter rates with advected predators.","4384":"Planktonic larval development, common in many benthic marine invertebrates, is associated with both costs and benefits relative to benthic larval development. Costs of being in the plankton include increased susceptibility to advection away from habitat and starvation. Potential benefits include reduction in predation for pelagic larvae. Few studies have measured predation rates on larvae in the field. Even fewer have directly observed larval predation events, documented the specific predator, mode of predation, and intervals between predator attacks. In this study we investigated benthic and pelagic differences in predator assemblage and predation interval on megalopae of the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister. To observe the predation events, we combined methods of tethering larvae with automated motion analysis of underwater camera images from daytime deployments off the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories, Friday Harbor, WA. We measured number of predation events, the interval in which those events happened, the species of predator, and of other non-predator species that comprised each visible community. Predation was higher on the benthos than the surface, with more total strikes and a shorter interval to predation. Only one predator species was seen during the trials, Artedius harringtoni. These results are consistent with previous studies, and support the novel combination of methods to better inform predation interactions of communities and their relative importance on each species.","4385":"The benefits of spines in zoea and other crustaceans have been documented in numerous studies as a form of anti-\u00ac\u221e\u00ac\u00a9\u201a\u00c4\u00eapredatory behavior. This study examined the potential costs of having spines using three different methods. Drag forces on spines were calculated using hydrodynamic equations and compared between zoea models with long and short spines; clay models were used in corn syrup sinking rate experiments to measure drag coefficients; and zoea models were created in FreeCAD and ran through a shear simulation in MATLAB to examine their stabilities. The study found that the presence of spines increased the drag forces on the models both through calculations and through direct measurements in corn syrup. Moreover, the presence of spines made models more susceptible to tumbling under shear when the spines were flared. However, if long spines were held in typical positions, the zoea models were actually more stable than the short spined model. This study highlights some of the plausible costs associated with spines and further studies are needed to examine the relative importance between hydrodynamic costs in spines versus decreased risk in predation.","4386":"The sensory organs of larvae of the bryozoan Bugula c.f. californica are very important during the short transition from the swimming phase to the brief settlement phase. These sensory organs detect environmental cues that initiate and regulate settlement within a favorable habitat. However, these organs may also allow the larvae to perceive unfavorable habitat and avoid predation. This study looked at the settlement response of the competent larvae of Bugula c.f. californica when they came in contact with traces of a predatory nudibranch, Janolus fuscus, with a known positive settlement cue (biofilm), and with traces of a non-predatory nudibranch, Archidoris montereyensis. A known number of larvae were kept in small petri dishes filled with filtered seawater at about 12 degrees Celsius with no flow inside the dishes. Prior to adding the newly released larvae, the petri dishes were divided into four groups that were smeared with the three following treatments: mucus from the predatory nudibranch, mucus from the non-predatory nudibranch, and a thin layer of biofilm. Clean (un-filmed) dishes with FSW served as the control. A second study looked at preferential settlement with the known positive- biofilm, the biofilm substratum with predatory water, and \u00ac\u03a9 biofilm substratum next to \u00ac\u03a9 predatory mucus substratum. We found that the larvae in the biofilm with FSW settled early in their planktonic period. The larvae in the dishes with predator mucus, dishes with biofilm and predator water, in dishes with a choice of biofilm or predator mucus delay their settlement- perhaps in search of optimal habitats. Furthermore, when the biofilm and predator mucus exist in the same dish, the larvae preferentially settle in the side with biofilm, which suggests that they try to avoid potential predation.","4387":"The behavior of sea star brachiolaria larvae is poorly understood and the role of their elongated posterior processes in swimming is unknown. We attempt to characterize swimming speed and behavior in the late stage brachiolaria of Pisaster ochraceus in order to form a metric for larval health and to better understand the role of larval behavior in feeding and dispersal potential. We found that larvae swim faster in the presence of food and sink at a consistent rate when cilia are removed, which does not vary linearly with body or process length. In a simulation of simplified model brachiolaria in horizontal shear flow, larvae with their posterior processes parallel were more stable, while larvae with angled processes began to tumble at lower levels of shear. Further investigation will use video analysis to assess larval movement in varying levels of vertical shear that we created in a column using a rotating belt.","4388":"Food acquisition is a necessary component of survival for any organism and in order to feed effectively, a predator must meet the mechanical demands of its prey. This study\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s focus was to make general observations and conclusions about the evolution and adaptation of several morphological traits of pacific salmon jaws based on varied feeding behaviors. Dissections of juvenile king, adult king, and keta salmon were performed, during which measurements pertaining to the articular joint and adductor mandibulae were taken and recorded. The study found that king salmon have stronger adductor mandibulae, while keta have stronger skeletal jaw components. This trade-off is a morphological adaptation in which either force or velocity can be prioritized. Each species\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 jaw anatomy is specialized for their diet and feeding habits, for example stronger jaws to accommodate the crushing of tough prey or fast jaw closure for hunting fish prey. Other conclusions, like the positive correlation between head length and adductor mandibulae mass, were also drawn from the study.","4389":"The overabundance of one species in a particular area is typically bolstered by a biotic or abiotic factor that allows them to outcompete other species for space and resources. The undersides of the docks in the town of Friday Harbor and at the Friday Harbor Laboratories are overrun with white plumose anemones, Metridium farcimen. The sewage output in the town docks contains particulate matter, which the prey of M. farcimen may feed on. To determine if particulate matter contributes to M. farcimen abundance, I collected specimens from both locations, placed them in controlled tanks and exposed them to separated samples of zooplankton of varying sizes. The anemone did not show an overall preference for food particle size, although they did show a slight preference of 0.3 mm particles over 0.5 mm particles. It is possible that they are consuming all size classes of zooplankton that feed on sewage particulates.","4390":"Docks in the Friday Harbor Island have been observed to have many nudibranchs present on them. One hypothesis for this is the creosote, a chemical used to help preserve the wood from wear, is attracting them to the pilings. Creosote has been shown to have negative effects on the environment, and because nudibranchs\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 rinophores are sensitive chemoreceptors that are used to help find food, navigate, and find mates, an interaction could be harmful to these animals. Our study looked at the preference of location in a tank with one side having creosote-treated wood and one side having non-treated wood samples. We used Triopha catalinae (Clown Dorid) and Archidoris montereyensis (Sea Lemon) as our two species. We found there was no significant preference to creosote. We also saw no preference to creosote during the day or evening, but saw a trend in T. catalinae to prefer the sides of the tank especially during the afternoon runs. There was also a trend to avoid the drain in the tank for both species. Nudibranchs therefore show no attraction to creosote in their environment.","4391":"This paper looks at the forces involved in the attachment of M. farcimen to substrate. Many sessile and transitory, aquatic animals rely on the secretion of an adhesive glue for attachment to substrate, like most sea anemones. However, other attachment mechanisms exist. For example, limpets and clingfish rely on suction. The pull off forces of M. farcimen attached to substrate were tested, and then used to calculate tenacity. Two groups were compared. One group was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass with 1.5mm holes drilled throughout, and the other was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass without any holes. Tenacity calculations revealed that specimens were more strongly attached to the acrylic glass without holes, suggesting that suction is involved in M. farcimen attachment to substrate. Attachment site selection was also explored. When M. farcimen were given the choice between substrates with holes and substrates without holes, there was no significant difference in the frequency of selection for attachment.","4392":"The marine intertidal is an area prone to high wave energy and flow velocities, and the organisms living there are subjected to large hydrodynamic forces, such as drag. These forces acting to dislodge organisms may result in reduced foraging efficiency and depressed overall growth. In this study the body shape of a snail, chiton, and limpet are subjected to flume testing to observe how drag forces and drag coefficients change with a range of Reynolds numbers simulating currents up to 6 m\/s. In higher flow velocities the snail body shape experienced drastically higher drag forces than the limpet and chiton body shape. The drag coefficients for the limpet and chiton both were relatively high at low flow velocity, and quickly decreased at higher speeds. The snail however experienced an opposite change in drag coefficient, with a lower drag coefficient at low flow speeds and increased with higher flow speeds. When compared to Reynolds number drag coefficients for the limpet and chiton show little change at higher Reynolds number, contrast to the snail body shape in which the drag coefficient appears to fluctuate with increasing Reynolds number.","4393":"The foraging behaviors and prey choice of intertidally foraging birds is largely undocumented. A series of four observations on prey choice was done at a discrete site during low tidal heights (&lt;.0.61 m) and high tidal heights (&gt;1.52m). Prey was defined as three distinct categories, \u201a\u00c4\u00faFish\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, \u201a\u00c4\u00faCrustacean\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, and \u201a\u00c4\u00faOther\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. There were significantly more crustaceans consumed than fish or other organisms. No observed feeding during high tidal heights. Conspicuous consistent behaviors also noted but not formally analyzed. There is potential for intertidally foraging birds to have top-down control of intertidal ecosystems.","4394":"Chitons, like other mollusks, rely upon a variety of adhesive forces to combat factors such as wave action and predation in the intertidal. In this study, we explore what effect suction has upon a chiton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s total force of attachment and tenacity, as well the impact of substrate roughness. In this experiment, we found that suction plays a significant role in chiton attachment over a range of roughness. We also found that a chiton\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s adhesive tenacity decreases significantly upon rougher textures.","4395":"To prevent constant competition across species, different species may develop different morphologies to increase their ability to attain a certain food source within a niche. By dissecting the adductor muscle and taking measurements in four sculpin species we can begin to assess how their feeding styles and niches influence their jaw morphology. Many parts of the jaw, such as the mandible, grow with the individual size of the organism, contributing to an ability to consume bigger prey. The advantages of more bite force for crushing harder prey, such as in Enophrys bison, are compared to the advantages of higher velocity and fluid flow in the buccal cavity, such as in the suction using Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. We also found that bigger adductor muscles does not actually lead to larger gape angles, but in fact decreases the maximum gape angles.","4396":"The gastropod nudibranch Tritonia tetraquetra is a convenient model organism for neurobiologists. It appears unique among nudibranchs in its ability to detect and orient to the magnetic field of Earth, which makes it an interesting basis for comparison. In our study, we assess the potential of magnetoreception in another nudibranch that shares a similar geography and lifestyle, Armina californica. We examine the neurons in Armina that are reported to be homologous to the known neural correlates of magnetoreception in Tritonia, and attempt to observe changes in activity while providing magnetic stimuli. Furthermore, we look for potential behavioral clues in the reorientation of displaced animals in natural and unnatural magnetic fields. Our results demonstrated that although A. californica and T. tetraquetra lead similar lives, Armina exhibited no significant responses to magnetic stimuli, either in neurophysiological or behavioral assays. These results suggest that Tritonia may be more unique than previously thought, and that magnetoreception may be limited to a very specific subset of gastropods.","4397":"Species with overlapping geographic ranges, similar morphology, and ecological roles often vie for the same resources and therefore face competitive exclusion. This competition can be reduced if species vary in skeletal and muscular anatomy, because it changes biomechanical performance across species. We examined biomechanical variation of feeding structures in a group of nineteen sculpins (Cottoidea) that co-occur in the marine habitat around the San Juan Islands. We quantified evolutionary correlations of skeletal morphology and muscle morphology by conducting phylogenetic independent contrasts using a phylogeny constructed from published molecular data. We hypothesized that skeletal leverage (mechanical advantage) and muscle architecture (gearing) could either display a positive evolutionary correlation (changing over evolutionary time to perform inversely of each other), or the features could display a negative correlation (changing over evolutionary time to perform in the same way). We found a positive correlation between evolutionary shifts of out-lever length and adductor muscle length, but no correlation between evolutionary shifts of in-lever length and adductor muscle length or adductor muscle length and lever ratio. Our results demonstrate that skeletal leverage and muscle architecture evolve independently in individual species of sculpins. These results also suggest that these two functional units (skeletal morphology and muscle morphology) both contribute to biomechanical diversity in closely related, geographically co-occurring sculpin species, indicating their importance as metrics of ecomorphological diversity.","4398":"Arion rufus was recently introduced from Europe to the Pacific Northwest and may compete for resources with the native banana slug Ariolimax columbianus. I conducted feeding trials with the plants pathfinder (Adenocaulon bicolor), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), lichen (Usnea sp.), and store-bought white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) to observe how similar the feeding preferences were across species, which were more closely analyzed by size class, source population (Douglas-fir forest or grassland), and color morph for Arion rufus. The white button mushrooms were preferred to the other three food choices across all the different source populations. Mushrooms are typically scarce in both the Douglas-fir and grassland habitats so I found this data interesting and compared oven-dried mushrooms and reverse-osmosis water soaked lichen. All the populations preferred the soaked lichen, which may indicate a preference towards texture and moisture rather than a food preference. I observed the effects of temperature on feeding rates among the different source populations. Arion rufus consumed spinach leaves at the same rate across the three temperature treatments (4\u00ac\u221eC, 10\u00ac\u221eC, and 20\u00ac\u221eC); however, the large Ariolimax columbianus may be consuming the least at 10\u00ac\u221eC. This surprising result suggests that the slugs did not have their typical nighttime feeding temperature as their optimal temperature, nor did they increase feeding rate continually with increasing temperature.","4399":"Suction feeding in ray-finned fishes is a highly kinetic behavior. Musculoskeletal components are arranged in linkages, which move in complex, 3-dimensional ways. In order to precisely measure the 3-D rotations and translations of bones during suction feeding, we developed a new imaging method called Video Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (VROMM). VROMM combines bi-planar high speed video with 3-D mesh models to create highly precise animations of real-life motions. Using VROMM animations, we evaluated the opercular linkage for lower jaw depression by measuring the rotation of the lower jaw and the operculum at the quadratomandibular and operculohyomandibular joints, respectively. We filmed two species of sculpin, Leptocottus armatus and Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus, during suction feeding, and also filmed a post-mortem manipulation where we pulled straight up on the operculum to simulate the dorsal rotation described by the classic 4-bar linkage. In the manipulated trials, the measured kinetic transmission (KT) for Leptocottus and Hemilepidotus was 2.3 and 2.0 respectively. The measured KT for the live Leptocottus was 4.0, and, notably, the operculum reached maximum rotation significantly before the lower jaw. These data suggest that in Leptocottus, operculum rotation is responsible for initial jaw depression, while other linkages subsequently drive the rest of mouth opening.","4400":"Specialized feeding behavior is generally reflected not only in skeletal anatomy (as has been the major focus of functional morphology literature) but also in muscular morphology and physiology. We show that this is the case for salmon feeding mechanics of king and pink salmon. King salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eat small, fast fish; and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) primarily filter feed on planktonic organisms by keeping their mouths open while swimming. Salmon close their jaws using the adductor mandibulae, which, like all skeletal muscles, is constrained by a strict relationship between muscle length and force. Muscles that are over-stretched or overshortened exert weaker forces than they do at optimal length, and muscle length corresponds to gape. We compared the force-length curves of king and pink salmon adductor mandibulae and demonstrated that the maximum bite force of king salmon is achieved closer to maximum gape (67% of max gape, n = 3). This may allow them to take advantage of optimal muscle length, and thus greater force production, when eating large or elusive prey. In pink salmon, the force-length curve is centered at a smaller relative gape, closer to mid-gape (43% of max gape, n = 6). This may facilitate filter feeding, allowing reasonably high forces at a range of medium gape sizes. The different feeding preferences of these species may have put different pressures on the evolution of jaw muscle physiology, resulting in distinct optimal solutions to the force-length constraint.","4401":"During suction feeding, many fishes use their epaxial muscles to generate a substantial amount of power to produce cranial elevation. When the muscles contract they reduce the angle between the head and body, causing the axial skeleton to bend dorsoventrally. Without axial bending, cranial elevation would be limited and feeding performance would decrease. The goal of this study is to locate where the vertebral column bends during suction feeding and relate this to the axial morphology of different species. We collected and analyzed live feeding data from three species (largemouth bass, pacific staghorn sculpin, and striped surfperch) using 3D animation techniques. CT scans were also analyzed with a focus on the shapes and spacing of the vertebrae, neural spines, and pterygiophores. Each of the three species had unique axial skeletons comprising differently shaped and spaced vertebrae, neural spines, and pterygiophores. We hypothesized that the axis of rotation for each species is located in the anterior-most region of the vertebral column, specifically between the vertebrae with the greatest space between the neural spines and pterygiophores. Our data show that the axis of rotation is consistent for largemouth bass (joints 3 and 4) and striped surfperch (joints 2 and 3), although both species bent at different intervertebral joints. These axes of rotation for both largemouth bass and striped surfperch correspond to the organization of the neural spines and pterygiophores. The staghorn sculpin presented an interesting case where all of its axes of rotation (joints 3, 4, 5, and 6) were not associated with any unique structures. However, cranial elevation increased at the more posterior joints. Given the great deal of interspecific variation of the axial skeleton, it is important to investigate the role of these different morphologies in suction feeding.","4402":"Hagfish are marine chordates that, despite lacking jaws, are able to feed on large, tough carcasses with the protraction and forceful retraction of toothplates. Using muscle stimulation experiments, we studied the function of the feeding apparatus muscles in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, and compared our results with muscle activity patterns recorded from previously studied Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Most of our efforts addressed function in the four major feeding apparatus muscles (the deep protractor, sphincter, perpendicular, and retractor muscles), and our stimulations of superficial musculature (superficial protractor muscles and rectus muscles) were assessed qualitatively. Stimulation experiments (tetanic contractions stimulated at 80 V, 60 Hz, 1 ms duration) were performed on in situ and excised feeding apparatuses from five animals positioned supine, while toothplate movements and muscle shape changes (strain) were analyzed from video recordings at 120 Hz. Our results confirm previous observations of M. glutinosa; in E. stoutii, the deep protractor muscles induce toothplate protraction, while activity in the retractor, sphincter, and perpendicular muscles power retraction of the toothplates. In both species, toothplate protraction causes the cylindrical feeding apparatus to decrease in length and increase in diameter, and vice versa during retraction. Upon excision from the body, the feeding apparatus in E. stoutii undergoes greater proportional length changes but smaller changes in width, suggesting that the soft tissue connections to the body wall impose constraints on muscle displacement. Because it comprises a large part of the head region (anterior 20% of total length), constraining the cylindrical shape of the feeding apparatus should work in retaining the cylindrical shape of the head while impeding unwanted head deformations in situations where the head must fit and maneuver in tight spaces (e.g. knotting and burrowing behaviors).","4403":"The average pH of ocean surface waters has dropped by about 30%, due to absorption of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In the past decade, much research has been conducted examining the effect of this \u201a\u00c4\u00faocean acidification\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 on marine organisms. Larvae seem especially sensitive. Acidification has been shown to affect chemosensory mechanisms and behavior of clownfish larvae, but little is known about how acidification may affect the sensory biology of marine invertebrate larvae. Like many marine invertebrates, the gastropod Crepidula fornicata settles and metamorphoses in response to chemical cues associated with favorable habitat for juveniles. Other studies on marine invertebrates have found decreased settlement and metamorphosis at lower pH, but none have measured how pH affects settlement and metamorphosis in response to cues from adult conspecifics. We tested the effect of pH on settlement and metamorphosis of four broods of larvae of C. fornicata that were derived from different parents. pH had a significant overall effect on both settlement and metamorphosis in the presence of adults, but not in the direction expected. Larvae settled and metamorphosed at higher frequency at pH 7.5 and 7.7 than at pH 8.0. While this pattern was seen in three of the four broods tested, response to pH treatment varied between broods. Further research is needed to determine if differences between broods remain consistent throughout the larval period, and might therefore reflect adaptations to variable pH regimes in estuarine environments.","4404":"On San Juan Island, WA, the invasive slug Arion rufus lives in two habitats, the Douglas-fir\/red cedar forests and the grasslands. The native slug of comparable size, Ariolimax columbianus, the banana slug, only lives in the forests, so Arion represents an inherently new type of herbivore\/decomposer in the local grassland ecosystems. At some sites, Arion is present at extremely high densities, making it likely that this new species may be altering the overall rate of nutrient cycling in its new habitat. We examined the effect of live Arion slugs and Arion feces on the growth of the annual ryegrass, Lolium multiforum, over a month in July 2015. We found no significant difference among our treatments (live slug, slug feces only, no slug impact) with any measure of biomass production. This finding seems contrary to what we expected based on prior research by other researchers which typically occurred in forested areas. Our results prompt the larger questions of how Arion impacts grassland ecosystems, whether the impact of Arion slugs on nutrient cycling in forests is different than its impact in grasslands, and, if this difference does occur, why it does so.","4405":"Flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) rapidly bury themselves under sediments using body undulations and fin movements. During burial, a fish must fluidize a volume of the substrate to displace it into the water column and distribute it over the surface of the body. Thus the burial behavior forces the fish to interact with the fluid environment and a granular medium and is affected by size of the organism and grain size. We used the English Sole, Parophrys vetulus, as a model to explore the effects of scaling on burial. We recorded burial events from 15 fish across a size range (5 to 30 cm in total length), keeping sand grain size consistent, using high speed video at 250 fps and determined undulation frequency, time to burial, and percent body coverage. We found larger fishes took longer to bury and moved with a lower undulation frequency, but were able to cover themselves as effectively as smaller fish (91.6%). Undulation frequency decreased with body length to the -0.53 power; time to burial increased to the 0.67 power. We also used 5 individual fish of similar size (5.7 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 8.1 cm) and changed the size of the particle provided as substrate (125 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 710 microns). We found grain size does not affect the undulation frequency or time to burial of small fish, but as particle size increases, the percentage of the body covered decreases. It is possible that fish cannot fluidize particles of larger grain sizes as effectively as they can smaller grain sizes. Taken together, these results reveal that the timing of flatfish burial is a function of fish size and the success of the behavior is affected by the relative grain size of the sediment.","4406":"Tidepool sculpins (Oligocottus maculosus) are intertidal fish that use a novel mode of terrestrial locomotion to traverse their semi-terrestrial environment. Our goals were to describe the kinematics of the terrestrial locomotion of O. maculosus and compare their terrestrial locomotion to their aquatic locomotion, the terrestrial locomotion of subtidal sculpin species (Leptocottus armatus and Icelinus borealis), and the terrestrial locomotion of walking catfish (Clarias spp.). We used high-speed video to record locomotion on a terrestrial platforms and in water, and landmark tracking software in MATLAB to analyze their locomotion. O. maculosus use a novel form of axial-appendage-based locomotion, driven by lateral oscillations of the tail synchronized with alternating rotation about the base of their pectoral fins, described as an \u201a\u00c4\u00faarmy crawl\u201a\u00c4\u00f9. Unlike Clarias spp., which use a diagonal gait, O. maculosus use a lateral gait. The army crawl likely originates from a modified series of aquatic fast starts in a terrestrial environment. However, they use axial undulation of the body during aquatic locomotion, whereas they use axial oscillation and pectoral fins in terrestrial locomotion. The army crawl is more effective at moving linearly on land than the terrestrial \u201a\u00c4\u00fawiggle\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 used by subtidal sculpins. It is possible that the earliest vertebrates on land used forms of terrestrial locomotion analogous to the terrestrial locomotion of fishes. Actinopterygians like O. maculosus may have begun the transition onto land before the rise and terrestrial success of sarcopterygians by using behavioral adaptions, which would not show in the fossil record like morphological adaptations.","4407":"This study focused on the predator prey interactions of two predators, the crab Pugettia gracilis, and sea stars of the genus Leptasterias and two low intertidal \/ shallow subtidal zone herbivorous snails, Lacuna vincta and Lacuna variegata. L. vincta and L. variegata graze on macroalgae, including Ulva spp.and Saccharina sessile, as well as microalgae such as diatoms that occur on the eelgrass Zostera marina. The feeding rates of P. gracilis and Leptasterias spp. on these two species of Lacuna were determine by in lab experiments, which included no choice and preference experiments. We found that P. gracilis ate significantly more L. variegata per unit time than Leptasterias and that the two predators had the same feeding rate on L. vincta. In choice tests P. gracilis preferred L. variegata. Seastars showed no preference. Neither predator was size selective and the size of the predator did not have a meaningful impact on the number of eaten snails or the size of snails eaten. The vulnerability of Lacuna vincta and Lacuna variegata in eelgrass and macroalgae habitats in the presence of the two predators was tested through mesocosm experiments. Because of the low recapture rate in controls, we were unable to detect significant differences in feeding of the two predators on the two species of Lacuna in the two habitat types.","4408":"Global temperatures have been steadily increasing annually, causing increases in artic ice melting. The resulting freshwater from this artic ice retreat enters local river systems, which flow down to the Pacific Northwest and add freshwater to the Salish Sea. With significant melting occurring in the summer months from May to June, the Salish Sea receives multiple influxes of low-salinity water every summer that can persist for a couple of days. These freshwater events can lower surface water salinity from normal 31\u201a\u00c4\u221e to as low as 21\u201a\u00c4\u221e. Understanding the impact of these low-salinity events is particularly important for the larvae of seastar Pisaster ochraceus, which are limited in their ability to swim out of low-salinity surface waters. Since P. ochraceus can take over 200 days to develop and metamorphose, larvae are bound to experience at least one lowsalinity event during their development. This study looked at the effect of a constant lowsalinity environment verses a fluctuating salinity environment on P. ochraceus survival, morphology, development, and protein expression. No significant differences in survival and body size were found between treatments. However, low-salinity reared larvae had significantly shorter posterolateral arms, which has implications for feeding and swimming behaviors. Osmoregulatory and mechanosensory protein expression was upregulated in fluctuating salinity treated larvae, while low-salinity reared larvae were not significantly different from the controls. This upregulation indicates that P. ochraceus larvae are changing their protein expression in response to the lower salinity environment.","4409":"We were interested in learning how olfactory cues that guide navigation in the gastropod nudibranch Tritonia tetraquetra, formerly known as Tritonia diomedea are received by the rhinophores in turbulent flow. We measured boundary layer thickness at various speeds, and characterized water flow turbulence caused by their rhinophore. This was done using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) around a fixed (dead) rhinophore on a clay model slug. We predicted with increasing flow speed, boundary layer thickness would become thinner. Results from this experiment were deemed inconclusive. We also characterized cilia-generated flow on the clavus of three species of nudibranch (Tritonia diomedea, Tritonia festiva, Armina californica). Dye flow patterns show cilia-driven currents from near the distal region of the rhinophore to the proximal region of the rhinophore. In Tritonia, the current originated at the distal tip and flowed proximal into the folds of the clavus, then spread outward towards the circumference of the base of the clavus. In Armina, the flow was unidirectionally proximal along the infolds of the rhinophore. The cilia on the rhinophore may help the animal respond faster to odor changes by removing the boundary layer (i.e. sniffing). Scanning electron micrographs showed that the tuft at the distal end of the rhinophore (a.k.a. clavus) had large patches of dense cilia on its vertical inner folds, but lacked dense cilia on the parts of clavus that are more exposed around the circumference.","4410":"Dispersion patterns of individuals within a group can reveal important aspects about social interactions and the mating system of the species. Our study examined the distribution patterns of the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, to determine the influence of sexual selection on the mating system. Male and female Anisolabis maritima both possess weaponry \u201a\u00c4\u00ec however, females are very aggressive whereas males are tolerant of cohabitation, which led us to hypothesize that leks might be forming, or that aggressive females would maintain territories that would control the group environment. We examined single-sex and mixed-sex groups of 18 earwigs in a large enclosure throughout their active period to determine whether they were distributing themselves randomly, uniformly, or in clumps. We found that, in single-sex groups, males form clumps and females form uniform territories. Mixed-sex groups are uniform at first and become clumped, where females controlled uniformity and males changed their behavior in response to females. We also conducted a series of trials between three individuals, either single-sex groups or mixed-sex groups with two different-sized individuals of one sex and one individual of the other, to examine sexual selection and cohabitation preferences. Among single-sex groups, we found that females were unwilling to cohabitate, and small females were more likely to be excluded from shelters than large females \u201a\u00c4\u00ec in single-sex male groups, however, males were willing to cohabitate, with small and medium-sized males equally likely to be excluded. Among mixed-sex groups we found a preference for smaller opposite sex partners, but the patterns suggest assortative mating.","4411":"As the concentration of CO2 in surface seawaters increases (ocean acidification, or OA) the saturation of calcium carbonate decreases, preventing marine organisms from creating shells and other calcified structures. These effects of elevated CO2 on calcification have been previously shown in free-spawning larvae, but are not as well-studied in larvae that spend their early life stages in encapsulation. The focus of our study was to determine what effects CO2 would have on a diversity of encapsulated embryos, and whether different types of encapsulating structures provided different levels of protection against OA. We found only a moderate larval response to low (600 ppm), medium (1050 ppm), and high (1500 ppm) CO2 concentrations across all species taken as a whole, but did observe that several species\/ populations exhibited a decline in shell length with no corresponding decline in inorganic content. This suggests that while calcification was not significantly decreased by our OA conditions, perhaps the morphology of certain shells changed, becoming wider and shorter. Our hatch times, which increased with elevated CO2, confirmed that increased CO2 placed embryos under stress during development.","4412":"Nereocystis luetkeana is an ecologically important species in the marine environment and when it washes up as drift it becomes ecologically important to the terrestrial environment, providing a crucial link between the two ecosystems. The first appearance of N. luetkeana has been observed to be during early spring and then they reach their full height in early summer and soon after become reproductive. During this time, their chances of entanglement increase and so do their chances of detachment. Their blades also contain a large amount of mass, and when the current causes those blades to go in one direction, it causes tension in the stipe which in turn increases the risk of detachment. This study focuses on quantifying the location of bull kelp failure (stipe, holdfast, or substrate) throughout spring and seeing when the most breakage was observed in the San Juan Archipelago. Significant patterns in the data were variable; two locations found to have statistical significance in the average stipe length between early and late spring showed opposite trends compared to each other. The variation in data trends, and the observed variation in sizes and stages in the life cycle suggests that the life cycle of N. luetkeana does not follow a certain seasonal schedule.","4413":"Like many marine ecosystems, the San Juan Archipelago has several critical species of forage fish in the middle trophic level. These species play a critical role in energy transfer. This study examines variations in diet across different species, locations, and seasons. I studied the Pacific sand lance, Pacific herring, and Surf smelt. In contrast to past studies that indicated PSL were preferential to calanoid copepods, in my analyses PSL appeared to feed on a combination of amphipods and copepods, while herring and smelt fed primarily on copepods. In comparing sand lance across multiple sampling locations, both in an established nearshore population at Jackson Beach and a newly discovered nearshore population at South Beach, we noted feeding activity and foraging behavior. PSL at South Beach eat primarily copepods whereas PSL in Jackson Beach are eating both amphipods and copepods. In contrast, no observable feeding activity was measured in the larger, older fish in the offshore location that we measured on multiple occasions (San Juan Channel Wave Field). Upon examining San Juan Channel data from spring 2015, fish appeared to be leaving their winter dormancy period. Based on this new data, the winter dormancy period was estimated to be between late February and early October.","4414":"Plankton are a major component in the marine ecosystem being the base of the marine food web. This study tries to study the relationship in the San Juan Channel of zooplanktons topdown control on phytoplankton as well as examining how different water properties effect the plankton abundances. North station showed a strong incidence of grazing having a large pheaopigment concentration ranging from 0.24 \u0152\u00bag\/L at the surface to 0.19 \u0152\u00bag\/L at 50 m depth. This was followed by a high concentration of solitary phytoplankton around 30.51%.","4415":"For organisms that live in groups, the spatial distribution of individuals according to size and sex can provide insight into social interactions, including aggression (intrasexual selection for armaments) and mating preferences (intersexual selection for ornaments). To gain insight into how group dynamics may influence the mating system, we investigated the relationship of density and morphology in the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, an insect found in high densities beneath pieces of driftwood above the high-tide line in coastal ecosystems throughout the world. There are fundamental differences in the behavior and morphology between the sexes. Males and females differ fundamentally in their aggression during agonistic encounters with conspecifics; males more readily cohabitate with conspecifics and resolve their disputes non-lethally whereas females often kill conspecifics in close proximity as they vigorously guard their offspring. Males also differ markedly from females in both body size (males are more variable in size, and sometimes substantially larger, than females) and weaponry (males possess asymmetrical, curved forceps whereas females have straight forceps). Given previously observed variation in both body size and forceps asymmetry, we investigated the possible correlation between population density and morphology of individuals in two populations on San Juan Island, WA to determine whether these parameters affect group dynamics and social interactions. Specifically, we lifted 10-15 logs at two sites (False Bay and Cattle Point) at two different times during the breeding season (June and July) and determined the overall density, average body size and average forceps asymmetry for individuals under each log. Comparing the area occupied to the body size and forceps asymmetry of individuals, we found that the relationship between body size and population density varied both by site and by the period in the breeding cycle. Additionally, we found a greater, more morphologically diverse population of males at False Bay, a site with lower tidal action and more predictable habitat availability. We posit, therefore, that the breeding cycle varies from site to site based on the stability of the environment, and that a more turbulent environment can disrupt the population and delay the breeding cycle, leading to a less diverse, more unstable population. Our results also suggest that larger individuals are more likely to live in higher densities before the breeding cycle, possibly due to their increased fighting ability and willingness to compete with others for mates, and at lower densities early in the breeding cycle due to their increased conspecific aggression during courtship and nesting. This research lays the foundation for future studies regarding the social dynamics of this species where we can monitor individual interactions and group distributions in a more controlled laboratory setting.","4416":"Habitat transitions provide opportunities for drastic changes in ecology, morphology, and behavior of organisms. The goal of this study is to determine whether the numerous evolutionary transitions from marine to freshwaters have altered the pattern and pace of morphological and lineage diversification within the sculpins (Cottoidea). The broad global distribution and wide-ranging ecology of sculpins make them an ideal study system in which to analyze marine invasions in northern latitudes. The sheer diversity of sculpins in isolated systems like Lake Baikal has led some to suggest these fishes (particularly Cottus) underwent an adaptive radiation upon their invasion of freshwaters in north Asia and Europe. Marine sculpins appear to be more diverse than freshwater sculpins, and while cottoids show signs of explosive radiation early in their evolutionary history, our study shows that unequal patterns of clade disparity among these lineages has led to constant rates of morphological and lineage diversification. Feeding morphology traits are highly conserved in cottoids, with both marine and freshwater species displaying similar morphologies despite widely-varying diets. While convergence in feeding morphology and dietary ecology is widespread in freshwater and marine cottoids, some specialist taxa, including planktivores and piscivores, show notable departures from the ancestral sculpin body plan. These include planktivores like Comephorus dybowskii, as well as piscivores Hemitripterus bolini and Myoxocephalus polyacanthocephalus. C. dybowskii\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s unique feeding morphology, including a high posterior mechanical advantage and long dentary bones, may be further explained by its habitation of the pelagic environment.","4417":"Rising atmospheric CO2 levels are associated with warming and acidification in coastal marine ecosystems, with impacts that are especially acute for marine calcifiers. We have investigated the interactive effects of pH and temperature on larval growth, time to metamorphic competence, and juvenile growth in the marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata. Larval growth rates and acquisition of competence for metamorphosis were measured in 4 replicate cultures in each of 4 treatment groups, representing all combinations of pH 7.6 and 8.0, at either 20\u00ac\u221e or 24\u00ac\u221eC. Higher pH and higher temperature additively increased larval growth, and larvae became competent for metamorphosis sooner at higher temperature and at higher pH, but there was no significant interaction of pH and temperature on larval growth rates or on frequencies of metamorphosis . After metamorphosis, juveniles from each larval condition were individually cultured at either pH 7.6 or 8.0. Temperature was not controlled during juvenile growth; all individuals were exposed to the same ambient laboratory temperatures of 21\u00ac\u221e-23\u00ac\u221eC. Juveniles grew at similar rates in both pH conditions. However, juveniles reared at 24\u00ac\u221e as larvae grew more slowly than their siblings that had been reared at 20\u00ac\u221e C as larvae, during the first 7 days of post-metamorphic growth. This difference was no longer apparent by 11 days after metamorphosis for juveniles derived from most larval conditions. However, slower growth persisted in juveniles that had been reared as larvae at 24\u00ac\u221e and pH 7.6, and kept at pH 7.6 after metamorphosis. This result is consistent with related studies that show persistent effects of larval pH experience that emerge under some juvenile growth conditions.","4418":"Ocean acidification metabolically stresses marine organisms, especially those that must expend energy to deposit calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Nutrition may interact with pH to exacerbate or counterbalance acidification effects in early developmental stages. Previous work had indicated that growth of larvae and juveniles of the caenogastropod Crepidula fornicata is resilient to acidification within the pH range of 7.6-8.0 when animals are given a high-quality diet of Isochrysis galbana (ISO). We therefore reared larvae and juveniles at two levels of pH (7.6 or 8.0) and on either a diet of ISO or a poorer-quality diet of Dunaliella tertiolecta (DUN), and measured larval and juvenile growth and mortality as well as juvenile shell strength. Larvae grew about 30% faster, and juveniles grew about 50% faster, on ISO than on DUN. However, larvae and juveniles grew at similar rates at pH 7.6 and 8.0 within each diet treatment. Survivorship of both larvae and juveniles was not affected by pH, but was higher on a diet of ISO than of DUN. We thus did not find evidence for interaction of diet quality and pH in larval or juvenile growth or mortality. Juvenile shell performance was tested by measuring crushing force after 20 d of postmetamorphic growth in each combination of diet and pH. Shells were 25% weaker at pH 7.6 than at 8.0 for individuals that were fed ISO, and 55% weaker at pH 7.6 than at 8.0 for individuals that were fed DUN, even though mean shell lengths did not differ between pH levels within each diet treatment. Rigorous assessment of the interaction of diet and pH on shell performance will require further study of how shell strength scales with age and size.","4419":"Algal species at Cattle Point on San Juan Island, WA have been monitored and surveyed by Friday Harbor Labs since 1971. This resource of data presented the opportunity to examine Cattle Point\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s algal species diversification over 47 years. The goal of this research was to examine the changing diversity as well as the zonation of the area over time. Through this paper, we examine differences in percent cover from 2006, 2008, 2013, and 2018 using the program PRIMER. A dendrogram and MDS plot of the Bray Curtis Similarity of the percent cover data was used to visually represent the data. According to the dendrogram, a group of zone 4 transects dominated by kelps were less than 10% similar to all the other transects. The percent cover data was then tested using ANISOM statistical methods. Zone 1 was found to be the most differentiated from all four zones. This result matched the data from the dendrogram and MDS plot. No conclusions could be drawn from the ANISOM results on comparing the years due to different sampling methods. Using data from 1971-3, 2008, 2013, and 2018, presence\/absence data of 49 species were examined. The number of species present increased and peaked in 1973 and 2008 and declined moving forward to 2018. Lastly, the change in percent cover of Fucus distichus was examined and found to be in overall decline. From all of these results, a lowering level of Fucus distichus as well as biodiversity was seen over time.","4420":"The present study aims to test both the daily locomotor activity of Staghorn sculpins (Leptocottus armatus) and the effect of the time of day on the escape response in this species. The daily locomotor activity of 12 individual fish was evaluated in 2 sets coinciding with two opposite tidal stage in nature (low and high tides). Fish displayed mainly nocturnal daily activity (82.5 % of daily activity occurring at night) during a 24 h cycle under a simulated natural photoperiod of 15 h Light: 9 h Darkness (switch on at 05:30 h and switch off at 21:30 h) independently of the tidal phase in nature. Moreover, the escape response to a mechanical stimulus was investigated at 4 different times of day (at 01:30, 07:30, 13:30 and 19:30 h). Sculpin escape response depended on the time of day since lower responsiveness (20.6% of fish showed escape responses) and longer travelled distance (26.40 cm) occurred at night (01:30 h) than during the daytime (58.8% of mean responsiveness and 16.76 cm as mean travelled distance). In contrast, no statistical differences between times of day were found in some escape response parameters, such as directionality (fish always went away), latency, turning angle and turning rate. These results suggested the elusiveness of sculpin is more reduced during their activity phase (at night), but if they then respond to the stimulus, their fast-start performance is greater in terms of travelled distance.","4421":"Coastal fish are daily subjected to several environmental changes mainly due to tidal rhythms. Hypoxic conditions are widespread in many coastal habitats and their occurrences have been increasing over the past years thanks to human activities. Our study used a simple turning preferences test (detour test) to assess the effects of hypoxia in fish behavioral lateralization using three commonly diffused coastal species as a model (Cymatogaster aggregata, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Leptocottus armatus). We found that hypoxia exposure disrupts behavioral lateralization at population level in Leptocottus armatus. In the population used in our experiment individuals showed a distinct preference for right turns in the detour test. After exposure to hypoxia (20% [O2] for 2 hours) individuals showed equal probability to turn right or left. Given the value for survival of behavioral lateralization (e.g. enhanced of cognitive and escaping ability) this loss in behavioral lateralization could have severe costs for individual fitness in hypoxic environments. No effect was found in the other two species, which did not show behavioral lateralization on the population level in the control treatment.","4422":"In the present study, I had two main objectives: First, to determine the rates, regions, and duration of elongation in a variety of kelps and, second, to compare the results obtained from use of the hole-punch and fluorescent labeling techniques. After reporting these results, I will briefly compare them with the results of previous studies of kelp growth. In conclusion, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques, concentrating on those used in this study.","4423":"Kelp, large seaweeds of the Phylum Ochrophyta (or Phaeophyta), Order Laminariales provide many essential functions to intertidal habitats all over the world, yet the factors that govern their productivity are understudied. This is becoming an increasingly important issue as kelp productivity and population sizes have decreased over time due to an overabundance of predation and changes in the environment, resulting in kelp deforestation with decreased resilience (Steneck et al. 2002; Krumhansl and Scheibling 2012, Wernberg et al. 2019). Kelp deforestation not only posits a biological problem to its surrounding ecosystem but also an economic problem as they are an important aspect of aquaculture, are utilized in many commercial products and support many commercial fisheries by providing habitats and food web support. The increasing vulnerability of these kelp forests has become a growing problem, especially as we find out more about the vital role that kelp plays in its ecosystem. Kelp forests play in important role in fighting climate change; they sequester carbon and provide blue carbon sinks, ameliorate ocean acidification, and provide complex habitats that encourage intertidal biodiversity. This suggests that kelp aquaculture is key to fighting climate change as well (Duarte et al. 2017).They are autotrophic and are primary producers that serve as a food source, both for herbivores as live plants that are fed on as well as through the detritus that they shed (Mann 1973). They exude dissolved organic material (DOM) from their blades that contribute to both the biotic composition of their surroundings as well as to epiphyte activity (James et al. 2020). Kelp provide structural functions as well; their detritus often forms complex habitats that allow for greater biodiversity of micro-organisms that live on the ocean floor, and the kelp beds can provide a similar function as well for macro-organisms such as juvenile fish (Figure 1, Branch and Griffiths 1988).\n \n As we increasingly discover the ways in which kelp are essential contributors to its local ecosystems, it becomes more important that further studies are conducted to learn more about their rates of growth and erosion and to study which factors may affect these rates. In this study we looked specifically at Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp), a brown alga that grows along the western coast of the US and is ecologically important to its surrounding habitat in the Salish Sea where this experiment took place. This experiment was conducted over the course of 6 years as a part of a spring quarter class at Friday Harbor Labs and we used a simple but effective method that can measure growth and erosion of S. latissima that was used at different depths and thus at different light levels. With this data we ask what the patterns of growth and erosion are in S. latissima and estimate the rate of growth and erosion in April and May.","4424":"Macroalgae are increasingly being considered as an important factor in natural ecosystems and in economies around the world. Ulva is one such genus that provides various ecosystem services to humans and marine environments. Within marine ecosystems Ulva is a primary producer, providing direct nutrition for herbivores such as sea urchins and snails, and creates vital habitat structures for juvenile and larval organisms. Ulva can be both a cost and a prize to our economies as is both a significant component of the aquaculture industry and a major source of marine biofouling. Ulva zoospores have been known to settle due to bacterial cues and have an observed distribution primarily in the mid to low intertidal. This study attempted to quantify settlement of the quadriflagellate zoospores of Ulva fenestrata on bacterial biofilms from a variety of tidal heights. The goal was to ascertain if bacterial assemblages specific to tidal height were an impacting settlement factor. Competency time was also investigated to ascertain how long Ulva fenestrata zoospores remain motile. All bacterial biofilms were found to have equal recruitment, with no statistical differences in spore settlement. Zoospores were found to remain motile for up to three hours and 30 minutes with some variability. These findings indicate that observed distributions of Ulva fenestrata are due to some nonbacterial settlement cue or outside pressure and opens up further research questions into the nature of this cue.","4425":"Developing embryos of near-shore marine organisms are subject to freshwater influx, which exposes them to low salinity conditions. This experiment tracked embryo development in kelp crabs (\u201a\u00c4\u00e3Pugettia producta\u201a\u00c4\u00e3)\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 exposed to three salinity treatments [32, 23, and 9 parts per thousand (ppt)]. Data from this experiment indicate that the rate of embryo development is not affected by salinity within the range of 9 \u201a\u00c4\u00ec 32 ppt. Survival, determined by presence of heart beats, was highest in 32 ppt. No embryos survived after 24 hours in the 9 ppt. treatment. In addition to salinity testing, rates of embryo development were compared between the embryos cultured in dishes (\u201a\u00c4\u00e3in vitro)\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 and those allowed to develop in the abdomens of live adult females (in vivo\u201a\u00c4\u00e3). The results indicate that embryos develop slightly faster when raised \u201a\u00c4\u00e3in vivo\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 rather than \u201a\u00c4\u00e3in vitro\u201a\u00c4\u00e3, but that embryos can be reared successfully \u201a\u00c4\u00e3in vitro w\u201a\u00c4\u00e3ithout the use of antibiotics.","4426":"Chemical cues are commonly used to convey information to conspecifics and in marine invertebrates are often associated with larval settlement. This research set out to examine methodology surrounding adult-associated pheremonal settling cues observed in \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Dendraster excentricus. I\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 hypothesized settlement of juvenile \u201a\u00c4\u00e3D. excentricus \u201a\u00c4\u00e3could be induced via exposure to water that had been saturated in sand from adult sand dollar beds then filtered of visible particulate matter. This was tested by exposing larvae to both filtered and unfiltered concentrations of water associated with sand dollar sand and comparing the settlement rates. Data were inconclusive as only 1.3% of larvae settled and no significant trends were observed. Research still has potentially broad implications in refining established methodology surrounding D. excentricus\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 settlement inducers for use in laboratory based research.","4427":"As anthropogenic climate change progresses, increasing seawater temperatures play a large role in shaping changes in the range of benthic species. Predominate cold temperate kelp species are such an impacted organism; they grow at temperature below 18\u00ac\u221eC and are now seeing a decrease in available habit as they are threatened by increasing water temperature. Nereocystis luetkeana, a kelp with a floating canopy in the sporophyte phase is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from central California to the Aleutian Islands (Druehl 1969). As in all kelp species, it has a heteromorphic life history, which leaves two phases susceptible to increasing water temperatures. In this study N. luetkeana zoospores were grown in culture to determine how the young gametophyte phase reacted to elevated temperatures. To determine the upper temperature range of gametophytes, three temperature treatments were used to cultivate N. luetkeana zoospores found in the San Juan Islands, WA. A significant decrease in the number of gametophytes and their length were observed at temperatures exceeding 15\u00ac\u221eC. These findings indicate that the decrease in bull kelp beds could be highly correlated to the increase in temperature of the intertidal.","4428":"Hybridization in individuals can happen across varying levels of taxonomic relation; within species, genus, family, and orders in plants and animals. Although the more distinctly separate a relationship is between individuals in a hybridization event, the less biological fitness the resulting hybrid will have. Through the methodologies of rearing the hybrid larvae of the cross \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Dendraster excentricus\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 \u201a\u00c4\u00e3female\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 and \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Strongylocentrotus purpuratus\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 \u201a\u00c4\u00e3male,\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 observations of developmental progress across stages of both echinoids are made, and have been documented by previous studies. This study found no clear relationship between developmental stages reached in experimental hybrid larvae as compared to expected development stages in either parental donors. By asking if development in the cross of \u201a\u00c4\u00e3D. excentricus\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 and \u201a\u00c4\u00e3S. purpuratus\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 is parentally influenced, this study aims to make contributions to the lesser known \u201a\u00c4\u00e3in vitro\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 fertilization and larval rearing processes of sand dollar and urchin hybrids.","4429":"Nereocystis luetkeana and Alaria marginata were raised from zoospores into young gametophytes under three different light intensities. A. marginata, a species only occurring at shallow depths, was collected at a light level measured at 1505 \u0152\u00bamol m^-2\u201a\u00c4\u00a2sec^-1. N. luetkeana, a species germinating commonly at a depth of 5-30 m was collected from 8.17 m below the surface with a light level of 2.75 \u0152\u00bamol m^-2\u201a\u00c4\u00a2sec^-1. The study determined that there was no correlation between light intensity and gametophyte growth, and that there was no difference in gametophyte growth between the two-respective species. A. marginata was found to have a significantly higher proportion of zoospores germinated.","4430":"Echinoderm larvae, particularly those of class Asteroidea, are well-studied in a variety of fields ranging from marine ecology to developmental biology. Larvae are useful study organisms in that they are generally easily accessible and can be raised in large numbers at minimal cost. A proper diet is essential for raising larvae to metamorphosis and through the juvenile stage. This study investigates the effects of four algal diets on \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Pisaster ochraceus \u201a\u00c4\u00e3larvae in their bipinnaria stage: \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Rhodomonas sp.,\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Dunaliella tertiolecta,\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Isochrysis sp.,\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 and a combination of the three. Larval size was quantified sixteen days post-fertilization by measuring the maximum larval length, maximum larval width, maximum gut width, and right enterocoel length. Only the maximum larval width proved to be significantly different due to the diet treatments, with the D.tertiolecta\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 treatment growing the widest. One replicate of the combined diet treatment yielded larvae with a fused enterocoel, indicating an advanced stage of development, likely due to a decreased larval density as a result of high mortality. Although largely inconclusive, this study offers further insight into the effects of different algal diets on developing echinoderm larvae.","4431":"Primary producers break down light into different categories, allowing them to respond to light in multiple different ways. This paper answers the questions for Vertebrata hendryi, a filamentous red alga, which are: do sensory photoreceptor cells in V. hendryi play a role in developmental events by response to wavelength, and does V. hendryi grow better under a specific wavelength? Pieces of V. hendryi were placed in f\/2 medium-filled petri dishes within containers of different colored LED starboards to measure dimensions of cystocarps\/pericarps before and after the treatment, along with the number of cystocarps\/pericarps and branches. The results showed significant difference between the green and red\/far-red wavelength for the number of branches, suggesting increased vegetative growth for the alga under green light wavelength.","4432":"The site selection and attachment mechanisms of barnacles are studied extensively because of the negative impact of barnacles as biofouling organisms that attach to ships hulls and increase frictional drag. Site selection in barnacles occurs during a specialized larval stage known as the cypris stage. This paper investigates the effect of cyprid population density on settlement by comparing differences in settlement percentages between treatments with 5 cyprids\/ 10 mL water, 10 cyprids\/ 10 mL water, and 20 cyprids\/ 10 mL water. Cyprids were exposed to each treatment for one week. A single factor ANOVA was used to test for significance at alpha = 0.05. There was no significant difference in the average settlement percentage between treatments. Future research into antifouling technologies should investigate the mechanisms behind settlement cues that have a significant effect on settlement percentage such as light, salinity, flow rate, surface texture, conspecific proteins, and biofilms.","4433":"As climate changes, many organisms are affected, and affect their biomes as a result. Nudibranchs, a ubiquitous group of marine organisms, are known for their beautiful colors, but not much for their developing forms. Recently metamorphized nudibranchs have fragile shells and survive in the benthos inhabiting a completely different niche than their grown forms. Doris montereyensis is a widespread dorid nudibranch species native in the Eastern Pacific from British Columbia to Baja California. Its pelagic form hatches in early summer and develops as the water warms. This study looked at how temperature variation affected the development of larval stages (shell length and cross-sectional area). Across three developmental temperatures (9, 15.5 and 20\u00ac\u221eC), shell length was not seen to increase singificantly, wherease average area was larger in colder conditions. The warmest water treatments saw death in all replicates. This may be due to experimental error or be a sign of a deeper scientific phenomenon. If temperature causes larvae to die, as sea temperature rises, this could be fatal to nudibranch populations, If, as other literature states, growth increases with slight increases in temperature, this may increase the natural range of many species, disrupting ecosystem function. Regardless, further study is needed to quantify the effects of a warming ocean on nudibranch populations.","4434":"Previous findings supporting increased cloning in Dendraster excentricus (D. excentricus) larvae as a response to predator cues, in particular fish slime. Such findings report a \u201a\u00c4\u00favisual predator hypothesis\u201a\u00c4\u00f9, suggesting that the larvae clone in order to become smaller and thereby avoid visual predators and possibly even non-visual predators. The experiment reported here builds upon earlier findings by studying the exposure of D. excentricus larvae to a kelp crab effluent (using Pugettia producta) and a crustacean dominant plankton effluent. Individual larvae were exposed to one of three treatments: the kelp crab effluent, plankton effluent, or filtered sea water, for approximately 66 hours. After this period, number of clones, number of larval arms, and the rudiment stage of each larvae was determined. Linear modeling showed significant results when comparing the kelp crab treatment to the control for cloning (p=0.024) and rudiment stage (p=0.032); they also displayed significant differences for larval arm stage when comparing both the kelp crab effluent treatment (p= &lt;0.001) and plankton effluent treatment (p&lt;0.001) to the control. These findings may support the visual predator theory, depending on whether D. excentricus larvae are able to differentiate predator cues, and, if so, to what specificity.","4435":"Historically, most research on the effects of pollutants on acorn barnacles has centered around eliminating them from an area. They are among the most severe of marine foulants, and among the most difficult to keep from ship hulls. Copper paint or plating is the most common method for preventing barnacle recruitment on deep water vessels, but this can cause waters around ships and ports to have periodic spikes in copper concentration with unknown effects. In addition, sewage outfalls and runoff along coastline can result in already elevated levels, exacerbating the effects. Acorn barnacles are generally able to cope with high copper concentrations. In order to copper tolerance in the cypris larvae of a common acorn barnacle, 81 Balanus glandula l\u201a\u00c4\u00e3 arvae were collected off the west side of San Juan Island, WA, and placed in copper solutions similar in concentration to levels during copper spikes, and allowed to sit for 36 hours. All experimental larvae died without settling.","4436":"Cloning is a form of asexual reproduction that occurs in Dendraster excentricus and results in a decrease in size and developmental stage. Previous research has shown that D.excentricus larvae at the 4-6 arm stage clone both in response to predator cues and to an increase in nutrients. It is not known if the 4-6 arm is the stage where larvae clone the most or if they can even clone at other developmental stages. In the current study, individual larva were given food pulses at one of two developmental stages: the 4 arm stage [(4 days post fertilization (dpf)] and at the 6-8 arm stage (7 dpf). While it cannot be said for certain there were any cloning events, there was a large decrease in size of the larvae given the 4 dpf pulse from 5 dpf to 11 dpf as well as some morphological oddities that could have indicated cloning; one larva appeared to be budding.","4437":"A settlement cue produced by adult Pacific sand dollars, Dendraster excentricus, maintains dense aggregations of the species by inducing the metamorphosis of their larvae. This process is well-studied, but the unknown details are many. In May 2019, while studying at Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island, I attempted to add to the knowledge of this process by hand-rearing larvae and introducing them to sand which had been conditioned by adults of different sizes. The settlement data collected, while limited and nonsignificant, suggests that the 12-day timeline was sufficient for the adults to condition the surrounding sand, and that it is produced by adults, both big and small. Any nuance in the response to the cue remains to be discovered and could shed light on the adaptations to communal living in Echinoderms.","4438":"The pluteus larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus and their diel vertical distribution have been well studied in the field and in lab. However, there has not been much focus on how the larvae and their vertical distribution change as a response to entrainment by an incandescent light source. In order to test this, two groups of the D. excentricus plutei were set to different day\/night cycles, one receiving 12 hours of light, the other receiving only 5 hours. The swimming patterns and growth of these two treatments were observed and compared. The results indicated that the larvae could be entrained to incandescent light as vertical distribution and growth varied between the two treatments.","4439":"Marine ecosystems are threatened by climate change. Sea surface temperatures are rising as a result of global warming, which may influence the larval development and survival rates of many species. Decreasing the quantity of successful larvae, especially for keystone species such as \u201a\u00c4\u00e3Pisaster ochraceus \u201a\u00c4\u00e3(Ochre sea star)\u201a\u00c4\u00e3, \u201a\u00c4\u00e3has the potential to disrupt the predator-prey balance in a variety of habitats. The sea star wasting disease that passed through the west coast of the United States in 2013 greatly impacted populations of a variety of sea stars, notably that of the Ochre sea star, and emphasized the importance of sea star presence in intertidal ecosystems. By rearing ten day old \u201a\u00c4\u00e3P. ochraceus \u201a\u00c4\u00e3larvae in three different temperatures for a week, this study examines the growth, survival, and cloning rate of Echinoderm larvae in response to elevated sea surface temperatures. Larvae residing in temperatures of 20.15\u00ac\u221eC +\/- 2.65\u00ac\u221eC experienced the highest mortality rates and fastest growth, while larvae in local San Juan Island, WA, temperatures (9.13\u00ac\u221eC +\/- 0.47\u00ac\u221eC) exhibited the lowest mortality rates and slowest growth. A temperature range of 15.58\u00ac\u221eC +\/- 1.48\u00ac\u221eC produced intermediary growth and mortality rates, although the success of the latter is comparable to that of local temperatures. Medium temperatures induced the highest frequency of asexual reproduction. There was no difference between the cloning rate of high temperature and low temperature larval cultures. This study concludes that due to the exhibited larval sensitivity to temperature changes, it is possible \u201a\u00c4\u00e3P. ochraceus \u201a\u00c4\u00e3may experience population shifts or geographic redistribution as a result of sea surface temperature rise.","4440":"The red sea urchin, Mesocentrotus franciscanus, is an ecologically and economically important species. Although there has been extensive work on the life of the adults, little work has been done on the larval stage of its life history, namely the settlement cues of competent larvae. This study tested 6 treatments, with 24 hour exposure, to test which factor induced the most efficient larval settlement. At the conclusion of this study, Calliarthron tuberculosum, showed significantly higher settlement results for larvae, with an average of 12 \u00ac\u00b1 0.632 out of 15. Biofilms from purple urchins and urchin free environments also seemed to have an effect on settlement, but this was not as significant of a difference as the coralline algae. Red urchin biofilm, kelp detritus, and sea water did not have a significant effect on the settlement of the larvae.","4441":"Marine invertebrates exhibit complex life cycles comprised of various stages, each of which face varying abiotic and biotic challenges. Understanding how environmental stressors affect species during developmental stages is important, as conditions experienced early in their life history can influence stages later on in life. For our project we examined whether differences in field environmental conditions during early development influence thermal tolerance at the larval stage of the cephalaspidean snail, Melanochlamys diomedea. Our results indicate that larvae which developed in the upper intertidal zone did not differ with regard to thermal tolerance from those which developed in lower zone. This study suggests that the thermal differences of the developmental environment do not impact the early free-swimming larval stage of M. diomedea.","4442":"Metazoan lineages exhibit a wide range of regenerative capabilities in their adult forms, however, less is known about larval regeneration. Our study evaluated whether larvae of Spionid worms were capable of regeneration. We chose Spionids due to their abundance in the near-shore waters of Friday Harbor Laboratories (WA) and because information is available on their regenerative abilities as adults. We sought to answer the following questions: (1) do larvae survive after bisection? (2) do larvae exhibit wound healing and regeneration of the lost tissues at cut regions of the anterior and posterior body segments? To do this, we collected 78 larval Spionid worms, photographed each one and grouped them into tentative larval stage and species groups. We then bisected and monitored worms for survival and signs of regeneration. Overall, anterior body parts had higher survival than posterior body parts and regeneration was observed in both worm sections. However, we were unable to detect patterns in regeneration due to uneven sampling size per group. In order to better understand the difference between groups, surviving larvae will be barcoded to determine actual species. Future experiments should be extended to observe until complete regeneration occurs. Studies in regeneration, such as this one, are important as it can reveal evolutionary relationships among polychaetes, further our understanding of developmental processes in marine worm larvae, and understand survival under sublethal predation.","4443":"Hypoxia has the potential to influence marine organism function at many stages in the life cycle. Most studies on benthic invertebrates have focused on adult animals, but it is important to consider impacts on larvae, as they will have consequences for survival and recruitment of benthic populations. We sought to determine whether hypoxia alters the swimming behavior of Lacuna vincta larvae, and whether larvae are able to recognize and avoid hypoxic layers. We used video recording to compare larval behavior in stratified water columns with an upper layer with normoxic oxygen levels (~85% saturation, ~7.5 mg\/L) and a lower layer with hypoxic oxygen levels (~13% saturation, ~1 mg\/L), to behavior in similarly stratified columns where both upper and lower layers were normoxic (~85% saturation, ~7.5 mg\/L). The vast majority of L. vincta larvae recorded in the videos were concentrated at the surface in our experiments. Trends among the small fraction of larvae not clustered at the top 20 mm of the columns showed: (1) slower swimming speed along the path of travel in the hypoxic lower layer than the control lower layer, (2) slower downward velocity in the hypoxic columns than the control columns, (3) faster upward velocity in the hypoxic columns than the control columns, (4) the presence of larvae on the very bottom of the control columns versus a near absence of larvae at the bottom of the hypoxic treatment columns, and (5) a slightly higher fraction of time spent in the lower layer in the control columns. The small magnitudes of these differences may be due to the small number of larvae that traveled down below the surface in the columns in all treatments, or may indicate a relatively low sensitivity to hypoxia in this species. As global climate change continues and coastal hypoxia increases in frequency and severity, it is crucial to improve our understanding of the impacts of hypoxia across ontogenetic stages of marine invertebrates, so as to understand the implications for survival, recruitment, and population resilience. Results of this study demonstrate that upswimming tendencies may reduce encounters of L.vincta larvae with hypoxia, that larvae alter swimming behaviors in response to hypoxia, and that the observed behavioral changes appear generally consistent with a weak ability to escape or avoid hypoxia layers.","4444":"Swimming behavior in planktonic larvae has been suggested to affect their dispersal and recruitment. Behavioral regulation of vertical distribution can affect the extent to which larvae may accumulate in or escape from vertically sheared flows or fronts. Competent larvae of many invertebrate species are known to respond to various settlement cues in the environment by regulating their behavior in order to facilitate settling in suitable habitats. The behavioral responses of pre-competent larvae to cues from the adult habitat could have implications for retention, however such responses have not been investigated. In this project we have studied the swimming behavior in pre-competent larvae from the gastropod Lacuna vincta in the laboratory with the objective of determining whether behavioral changes in response to potential settlement cues are present in larvae at that earlier developmental stage. Potential settlement cues included in this study are eelgrass (Zostera marina), the kelp Agarum fimbriatum, and adult L. vincta, in addition to a control of filtered seawater. Pre-competent L.vincta larvae were recorded swimming in water columns containing water in which these various cues had been soaked, and their behaviors were compared across treatments. Videos were analyzed for mean upward swimming speed, mean swimming speed along the path of travel, mean oscillatory speed, and mean axial speed for each treatment. For all metrics, there were no significant differences between all four treatments and the control. The sample size of larvae was consistently low in the kelp cue as larvae remained on the bottom of the column, possibly due to high viscosity of that cue water. Our results indicated no response to adult habitat cues when larvae are pre-competent.","4445":"Decrease in dissolved oxygen levels is becoming more frequent in coastal marine environments. Causes may be of natural or anthropogenic origin, but human activities are having an impact on natural drivers. As organisms face many stressors in their environment, the need to understand how they respond to these increases. Most organisms have been studied at their adult life stage, while the embryo and larval stages are not considered. This study investigates the effect on marine invertebrate larvae of short-term exposure to hypoxia on selection of position in water column. It tests the hypothesis that larvae under oxygen-stress conditions will stay at the upper surfaces, where hypoxia is less likely to occur. An experimental setup was designed in which larvae could be placed in three columns, each filled with water a containing a different level of dissolved oxygen (DO) (three levels: 15 \u00ac\u00b1 1.71%, 36.7 \u00ac\u00b1 2.2% and 93.6 \u00ac\u00b1 0.97% DO). Larvae were then allowed to swim for 10 minutes, and their vertical positions in the experimental water columns were quantified. Three replicate swimming trials were conductued. . Larvae responded by choosing more the lower zones in hypoxic columns, while selection of upper zones was the most common in all treatments.","4446":"Phenotypic plasticity in larval organisms plays a large role in individual survival and populationwide recruitment. Intrapopulation variation that occur at the adult stage in response to different habitats and adaptive mechanisms are often passed on to progeny. In this study, we looked at the response of embryos of Membranipora sp. to prolonged UVA radiation exposure. We compared embryos of eggs from colonies collected in different light environments as a means of assessing embryonic variability in response to environmental stress. Colonies of Membranipora sp. were collected from two depths (0-0.5m and 1.8-2m) off of the dock at Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Islands, Washington. Stimulation of zygote release was achieved using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 0.1\u0152\u00baM concentrations, and embryos were irradiated with UVA light from a lamp continuously for 61 hours. We measured rate of development by counting hatched blastulae at semi-regular intervals over the course of this time period. Our results show that embryos from colonies at greater depth in the ocean are more susceptible to developmental delays caused by UV radiation than those from shallower depths. We believe this variation in response reflects the impact that local conditions have on parental colonies of Membranipora. These results suggest that there may be an acclimation response in parent colonies that can be conferred to their offspring.","4447":"Previous research has shown evidence of chemosensory behavioral responses in invertebrate larvae across species and using varying stimuli. Diverse exploratory behaviors in larval Membranipora spp. Cyphonautes on suitable settlement substrates (macroalgae) have been defined (Matson et al. 2010), but little is known about the behavioral mechanisms used to find settling habitats in the first place. We investigated the behavioral swimming response to hypothesized positive and negative chemical cues in late-stage cyphonautes larvae (Membranipora spp.) to determine whether cyphonautes have noticeably different behavioral responses to chemical cue plumes. We compared the response of larvae to a control (filtered seawater) cue, a positive cue (the red alga, Mazzaella splendens), and a negative cue (predator, Corambe spp.). Larvae were collected from plankton tows and exposed to plumes of cue water for five minutes under a unidirectional, laminar flow regime. Locomotory behaviors (swimming direction relative to flow, circling behavior, crawling behavior, tank wall interactions) were recorded. The results suggest that cyphonautes larvae swim more frequently toward the source of the cue when it is a positive cue, but do not respond negatively to predator cues (from a predator of their adult form). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that competent cyphonautes larvae actively use chemosensation to locate algal blades for settlement. Additionally, the results suggest that circular swimming and swimming perpendicular to flow, in addition to swimming towards a stimulus source, might aid cyphonautes larvae in finding substrate for settlement","4448":"Dissolved oxygen in coastal marine systems is projected to become more variable and is on the average declining in coastal systems. As surface temperatures and eutrophication continue to increase with climate change and anthropogenic inputs into marine systems, benthic marine invertebrates are expected to experience delayed development and reduced survival to metamorphosis. This study assesses the effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) stress on recently hatched Haminoea vesicula for the first 4 days of development as a planktotrophic veliger. Larvae survivorship and growth were compared between a reduced (~4.8 mg\/L) and saturated DO (~8 mg\/L) treatment. Dissolved oxygen stress did not significantly affect survivorship or any of the shell metrics measured. There was considerable variation in initial shell size (maximum shell dimension) which alone could not explain variance in growth rates within and among replicates and treatments. Given the small sample size, it is possible that limited statistical power precluded detection of an effect of DO on larval growth and survivorship. However, further research is needed to determine whether Haminoea vesicula, which experience DO stress during encapsulated embryonic development, are robust to DO stress. Additionally, studies should investigate if early exposure to DO stress post-hatching could have lasting effects via affecting time to competency, success at settlement, and juvenile performance","4449":"With continued climate change, coastal regimes in dissolved oxygen are expected to become more variable and severe. Larval marine invertebrates, particularly calcifiers like bivalves, have been identified as being sensitive to changing conditions. This study focuses on the effect of low dissolved oxygen (DO) and food stress on larval growth, lipid content, and survivorship following 6-day exposure to treatment conditions from 2 to 8 days post-fertilization. Using selected crosses between four maternal and 1 paternal lines, this study determined the effect of maternal background on larval response variables. Overall, reduced food and oxygen negatively affected growth but had no effect on lipid contents. Cohorts from different maternal lines responded differently within a DO x Food treatment combination, and highest performance did not always occur in the high DO x high food treatment. Counter intuitive differences in growth rates suggest plasticity in maternal investment or possible genetic by environment interactions. High variance in lipid content estimates existed within and among treatment combinations, and may require per larva measurements to account for inter-individual variation extrinsic to treatment level effects. Survivorship was &gt;80% overall and did not significantly differ for any maternal lines or treatment combinations. In this experiment, parental background explained 46% of the variance in larval growth, but only 2% of variance in lipid content. This suggests that larval M. trossulus are highly plastic in their energy budgeting during periods of stress, but alternative metrics to assess differences in lipids are needed.","4450":"As ocean and atmospheric temperatures increase globally, marine organisms will need to cope with or adapt to changing temperatures in order to persist. This is especially important in sessile species which cannot move to avoid stress. Parental effects, where offspring responses to environmental change are influenced by environments experienced by parents, may include mechanisms of coping with thermal stress. This study evaluated the degree to which thermal tolerance of larvae of the mussel, Mytilus trossulus, is influenced by parental environments. Adult mussels were collected from two sites of varying thermal stress on San Juan Island: Friday Harbor Laboratories dock (low stress) and False Bay (high stress). Air, water, and body temperatures were recorded in the field, and thermal tolerance (LT50) trials were conducted on adults and on their veliger larvae raised in the laboratory. Thermal tolerance was higher in adults from the high stress environment than those from the low stress site. For mussels from the FHL site, larval thermal tolerance was ~2\u00ac\u221eC higher than that of the adults. The opposite was found for mussels and their larvae from FB. Larval tolerances were higher for mussels from the low stress environment. This study concluded that thermal acclimation may have occurred in the two study populations. In addition, larvae of parents from the high-stress environment may be more susceptible to thermal stress than those from low-stress parents. Finally, larval tolerances were similar to or higher than adult thermal tolerances which suggests larvae may not be as vulnerable as suspected.","4451":"The kinematics and characteristics of escape responses have been heavily studied in teleost species. With some elasmobranchs being seen as mesopredators, escape responses do occur within this category of animals, thereby making the kinematics of the particular escape responses important parameters to understand in terms of predator-prey interactions; an area that is missing empirical data. This study have been divided in to two parts, with Part A concentrating on the latency of escape responses of the Pacific spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi, during mechanical stimuli, and Part B containing the an analysis of how the pacific spiny dogfish react when exposed to electrical and electrochemical stimuli in the form of a by-catch reduction device (BRD) and mischmetal, respectively. Latency was found to be slower than that found for teleost species, during mechanical stimuli. As several studies has found Mauthner cells in all teleost species and connected their function to their fast latency when reacting to a potential predator threat, our results suggest that the lack of Mauthner cells in elasmobranchs is resulting in a higher latency time. The kinematics of escape responses during electrical and electrochemical stimuli showed that these types of stimuli provoked slow escape responses compared to more sudden stimuli like mechanical stimuli and attack from a predator. Additionally, the turning angles of these escape responses was found to be quite large and the response to both the BRD and the mischmetal might be categorized more as an avoidance than escape. This supports the incentive that these devices can be used in the fishery industry to reduce their bycatch of elasmobranches and increase their capture efficiency.","4452":"Hypoxia is a stressor that occurs naturally in the environment. Hypoxic episodes are increasing globally due to anthropogenic nutrient loading and further exacerbated by global warming. This study examines the effect of progressive hypoxia, i.e. the continuous depletion of oxygen levels, on swimming performance at optimal speed of the pile perch, Rhacochilus vacca. R. vacca is a median-paired fin swimmer that exhibits obvious gate transition from pectoral fin swimming to anaerobic burst swimming using the caudal fin.. Oxygen consumption was measured during recovery from hypoxic conditions to determine whether an oxygen debt was associated with exposure to reduced O2 levels. The optimal swimming speed was estimated to be 1.7 bls-1, using strictly pectoral fin swimming, and gate transition occurred at 2.5 \u00ac\u00b1 0.13bls-1. When exposed to progressive hypoxia at optimal speed, critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) was determined to be 10.29 \u00ac\u00b1 4.07 kPa. When approaching Pcrit, burst swimming began at 7.07 \u00ac\u00b1 0.24 kPa O2. Pectoral fin beat frequency, significantly increased at 6.3-8.4 kPa oxygen saturation. Surprisingly, swimming speed was maintained beyond Pcrit, and the average oxygen levels at which fish quit swimming was 6.24 \u00ac\u00b1 0.30 kPa. There was a significant oxygen debt measured during recovery from hypoxia, which lead to a 200% increase in metabolic rate and took approximately two hours) to return to original levels. These unexpected results suggest that R. vacca are able to maintain optimal swimming speed in hypoxic conditions by resorting to anaerobic pathways, which leads to a significant oxygen debt.","4453":"The effect of multiple visual stimuli replicating predator strikes from two opposite sides were investigated in the Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) at different time points during the escape response. To trigger the escape responses, we used a visual stimulation (e.g., a looming image of an approaching black circle) simulating a predator strike. For the control treatment, only a single visual stimulus was used while for the treatments we played a second stimulus, simultaneously or with a delay of 33 or 83 milliseconds. Our results revealed that a second stimulus with a delay of 33 ms affects the escape trajectory with a change of turning angle during the stage one of the escape response. Such findings tend to suggest that the sensory feedback mechanism modulates the escape response.","4454":"In animals, group motion can be highly organized in oriented and polarized structures. In fish, such movement is referred to as schooling behavior, and while a large body of literature has focused on characterizing this behavior in relation to group size, the implications of having individuals of differences in body sizes on group cohesion and coordination are unexplored. This study focused on this knowledge gap and investigated characteristics pertaining to swimming behavior in surfperch Cymatogaster aggregata among pairs of similar and dissimilar size (i.e. groups of two big individuals, two small individuals, or one big and one small individual). We analyzed the swimming speed of both individuals, nearest neighbor distance (NND), and characterized the proportion of time spent swimming actively as a group for 9 pairs of fish. Results showed that individuals in big-big groups interact with one another almost half of the time (proportion of time spent swimming together was 48%), a high proportion relative to small-small or big-small groups (12% and 7%, respectively). Swimming speed distributions indicated that the big-big groups were the most active. The average swimming speeds were 135.5 mm\/s for big-big groups (equivalent to 1.37 BL\/s), 82 mm\/s for small-small groups (equivalent to 1.6BL\/s), and 116.3 mm\/s for groups of dissimilar size (equivalent to 1,05 BL\/s for the big fish and 2.32 BL\/s for the small fish). Although the observed patterns will require confirmation by completing the analysis with other pairs, and by quantifying other variables linked to locomotion and trajectory, these preliminary results show that while individuals of different size classes tend to adopt group swimming for shorter time periods than when paired with individuals of a same size class, they are also able to adjust their respective swimming speeds during such periods of interaction to maintain group swimming. The existence of such tradeoffs could explain the capacity of smaller individuals to remain in shoals and schools of mixed size classes.","4455":"Fish can enjoy a number of behavioural and hydrodynamic advantages during schooling. Shiner perches, labriform swimmers using primarily pectoral fins and assisting with the caudal fin, were used to study the differences of fin beat frequencies and oxygen consumption between a schooling pair of fish, a solitary fish, and a false pair where a single fish swam alongside a video of a conspecific. By having a fish swimming alongside a video of a swimming fish, compared with the pair of swimming fish, the hydrodynamic effect could be separated from the behavioral\/visual effect. It was found that pectoral fin beat frequencies were significantly higher for schools of two-real-fish swimming at 5.5 Bl\/s relative to other groups. Additionally the relationship between oxygen consumption and swimming speed was significantly different between treatments, with the false pair treatment having lower oxygen consumption from 3.5 Bl\/s and onwards. Our results suggest that the advantages of schooling are not only hydrodynamic but also behavioural, and that the relative importance of behavioural effects depends on the level of swimming activity.","4456":null,"4457":null,"4458":null,"4459":null,"4460":null,"4461":null,"4462":null,"4463":null,"4464":null,"4465":null,"4466":null,"4467":null,"4468":null,"4469":null,"4470":null,"4471":null,"4472":null,"4473":null,"4474":null,"4475":null,"4476":null,"4477":null,"4478":null,"4479":null,"4480":null,"4481":null,"4482":null,"4483":null,"4484":null,"4485":null,"4486":null,"4487":null,"4488":null,"4489":null,"4490":null,"4491":null,"4492":null,"4493":null,"4494":null,"4495":null,"4496":null,"4497":null,"4498":null,"4499":null,"4500":null,"4501":null,"4502":null,"4503":null,"4504":null,"4505":null,"4506":null,"4507":null,"4508":null,"4509":null,"4510":null,"4511":null,"4512":null,"4513":null,"4514":null,"4515":null,"4516":null,"4517":null,"4518":null,"4519":null,"4520":null,"4521":null,"4522":null,"4523":null,"4524":null,"4525":null,"4526":null,"4527":null,"4528":null,"4529":null,"4530":null,"4531":null,"4532":null,"4533":null,"4534":null,"4535":null,"4536":null,"4537":null,"4538":null,"4539":null,"4540":null,"4541":null,"4542":null,"4543":null,"4544":null,"4545":null,"4546":null,"4547":null,"4548":null,"4549":null,"4550":null,"4551":null,"4552":null,"4553":null,"4554":null,"4555":null,"4556":null,"4557":null,"4558":null,"4559":null,"4560":null,"4561":null,"4562":null,"4563":null,"4564":null,"4565":null,"4566":null,"4567":null,"4568":null,"4569":null,"4570":null,"4571":null,"4572":null,"4573":null,"4574":null,"4575":null,"4576":null,"4577":null,"4578":null,"4579":null,"4580":null,"4581":null,"4582":null,"4583":null,"4584":null,"4585":null,"4586":null,"4587":null,"4588":null,"4589":null,"4590":null,"4591":null,"4592":null,"4593":"Intertidal sponges and ascidians provide convenient animals to study species groupings with because of their lack of behavior and movement.

Collisella scabra was found to \"home\" and form grooves as a result of abrasion of shell and substrate. Factors affecting formation of grooves included time spent in one spot (related to homing), hardness of rock, and protection. The possibility is suggested that the C. scabra niche is an unprotected area where its superior ability to hold to the rock gives it an advantage as well as allowing it to form grooves.","4595":"The topography of a sandy, subtidal region near the Hopkins Marine Station (Monterey Bay, California) can be characterized as a series of low mounds separated by parallel troughs or channels. An examination of these areas proved that the mounds exhibit finer mean grain sizes, better sorting, more organic material, and greater abundance and diversity of meiofauna in comparison to the troughs. It is believed that the abundance of meiofauna, especially nematodes and harpacticoid copepods, can be related to the sediment sorting at the various stations. Mound sites are better sorted as they are in lower energy hydrodynamic regimes and are colonized by tube-building polychaetes (Diopatra sp.), which act to stabilize the sediment. The trough areas are believed to be rip-current channels, which concentrate bottom currents in narrow channel-ways due to the morphology of the shallow, submarine floor in the study area.","4596":"The aggressive behaviors of the California sea lion was examined with references to its components, sequence and ontogeny.

In asexually produced aggregations of C. californica all the individuals are the same color. Intraspecific interactions were observed in C. californica to determine whether there was aggression exhibited between the colormorphs. The results indicate that avoidance rather than aggression is the most commonly observed response.","4626":"Young Macrocystis pyrifera were tested for apical dominance. Plants were under a meter in height, all with just two fronds. One scimitar from each plant was removed on all but the control plant. Elongation of the laminae over a 9 day trial was measured and compared. No statistically significant differences at the 95% level of significance were found between the fronds with and without scimitars.","4627":"Aplysia californica has evolved an inking reaction to noxious stimuli. There are two theories of its function emphasized in the literature. The first suggests the ink may be a defensive screen similar to cephalopods. This is unlikely because the ink is not sufficiently dense to hide the animals. The second compares the inking to noxious secretions of other opisthobranchs (Kandel 1979). Predation on the adult Aplysias is very low due to the toxic material in the digestive gland (Winkler 1961). A known predator on small Aplysias, Anthopleura xanthogrammica, retracts its tentacles when it contacts the ink. The higher instance of inking when sea hares are in aggregations may suggest that the ink deters predators from the eggs. Feeding tests suggest that hungry Patiria miniata ingest the eggs. P. miniata show adverse responses to the ink.","4628":"Selected molluscs from Hopkins Marine Station and the Monterey Municipal Wharf were analyzed for copper concentration in soft parts. Atomic absorption analysis indicated higher levels of copper in animals from the Wharf area than in those from HMS. Magnification of copper concentration through trophic levels was not observed in organisms selected.","4629":"Oxygen evolution\/consumption and phototaxis in the clonal form of Anthopleura elegantissima, a sea anemone with symbiotic zooxanthellae, was investigated in order to draw comparisons between its phototaxic behavior and oxygen physiology. Anemones purged of their symbionts and placed into 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 115 ml of sea water demonstrated a marked decrease in the oxygen concentration of their surrounding sea water regardless of their periods of exposure to light. Anemones with symbionts, when placed in a lighted environment, showed an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration above that of their initial value. However, when placed in the dark, there was a substantial decrease in dissolved oxygen levels. Such findings would suggest that anemones with symbionts, when placed in an oxygen poor environment, would seek light so that the zooxanthellae could produce needed oxygen. Nevertheless, when anemones were placed in the dark halves of three different tanks (one oxygen-rich, one normal sea water, and one oxygen-poor),  showed a movement into the lighted halves of the tanks. A negative or neutral phototaxic response was observed, not the expected positive response. Thus it would appear that oxygen can not be implicated as a controlling factor in photosynthesis.","4630":"Optimal foraging theory predicts that for a predator limited to one prey there should be a prey size which maximizes the energy gained by consumption per unit foraging time. Observations were made of the predation of the intertidal gastropod, Acanthina punctulata, on populations of Littorina planaxis with a controlled distribution of size. Although size selection appeared to occur, it could not be compared with the theoretical predictions because of insufficient data. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the selection observed was due to physical limitations on the relationship between predator and prey sizes rather than energy maximization.","4631":"Clumping behavior of Olivella biplicata in a large outdoor tank was examined using a statistical test for a Poisson distribution. Clumping was observed in five of the six experiments. The effects of plant and animal material in the tank on horizontal distribution were examined. Avoidance and escape responses of the live snail to several of its gastropod and asteroid predators were studied.","4632":null,"4633":null,"4634":null,"4635":null,"4636":null,"4637":"Ulva blades are bathed in sea water containing DDT in the following concentrations: 0; 0.1; 1; 10; 100; 1000 ppb. As DDT concentration increases the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves seems to decrease. It also seems that the efficiency of chlorophyll to produce O2 decreases when DDT is present. This could be due to a change in the shape of the chloroplast.","4638":null,"4639":null,"4640":null,"4641":"The study of the importance of nitrogen and phosphate has been of prominent interest for sometime. These nutrients have been found to be indicative of the potential productivity of an area as well as the physical processes occurring. Even so the general overall scheme of nitrogen and phosphorous involvement is still somewhat up in the air. Many theories and isolated experiments have been reported but it is only recently that some of the basic facts have been agreed upon in general.
