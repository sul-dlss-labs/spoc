Welcome to the Species Occurrences (SPOC) project
==============================================

This project is based on a collection at [Harold A. Miller Marine Biology Library at Hopkins Marine Station](https://library.stanford.edu/hopkins), part of [Stanford Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu). 

Observations of marine plants and animals are “hidden” in the text of undergraduate student research papers. Researchers need this information but can’t find it, access it, or use it. The goal of this project is to employ natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization in ways that amplify the work librarians need to do to identify and verify these observations. 

There are three key parts to the effort:
1. Scientifically relevant entities are extracted from the corpus
  - Species occurrences (taxon/species + location (lat/lon) + date)
  - Keywords: most distinctive words, most frequent words, perhaps other entity sets TBD
  - Location(s) (named; “Hopkins Beach”, “Fisherman’s Cove”)
  - Habitat type(s) (e.g., “subtidal”)
2. Visualize the data as part of validation - where are observations located? What year? 
3. Serve the metadata to relevant aggregators, e.g., the Global Biodiversity Information Facility | GBIF. 

This document is where we will document our efforts and share outcomes.
