\section{Motivation For Datasheet Creation}

\textcolor{blue}{\subsection{Why was the datasheet created? (e.g., was there a specific task in mind? was there a specific gap that needed to
be filled?)}}

\Climate change is driving rapid changes in our biosphere on local and global scales. Our capacity to understand these shifts relies entirely upon two critical things: long-term biological and environmental observations, and an ability to discover and access them. Data over long time scales is essential, but observational data become more and more sparse the farther back in time you look. In an attempt to fill observational gaps in biodiversity data, we are exploring the potential contributions from a collection of undergraduate student research papers that were collected over serveral decades at coastal field research stations over the course of many decades. Observations of marine plants and animals are “hidden” in the text of the student research papers (Paper > TIFF > OCR > plain text). These historical observations are important historical markers for studies of biodiversity and the effects of climate change on species. The goal of this project is to extract species occurrences (genus-species, place, time) from student papers held in libraries along the western coast of the U.S., verify those observations, and contribute them to the Global Biodiversity Information Facilty (GBIF).

\This collection of undergraduate student research papers was assembled from several marine field research stations, with the potential for thousands more papers once the collections have been digitized (see Table 1). These papers were created annually, over several decades, as the capstone project for students taking an applied research course at their respective research station.

\textcolor{blue}{\subsection{Has the dataset been used already? If so, where are the results so others can compare
(e.g., links to published papers)?}}

\Prior to this work, the only papers that had been openly available online were the papers from the Friday Harbor Laboratories (https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/16338). Some of the papers were discoverable via online library catalogs at their respective institution, and some were not available at all. We are not aware of similar efforts to textmine species occurrences from student research papers using AI (but maybe link to work on text mining theses?). There is a project with the same idea - using undergraduate student papers as sources of biodiversity data - but the work of extracting the observations was done by hand.

necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is
a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the
larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this
representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the
larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of
instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).}}

If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other
data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.}}
