# Model Card
## Model Details. Basic information about the model.
* Person or organization developing model
* Model date
* Model version
* Model type
* Information about training algorithms, parameters, fair- ness constraints or other applied approaches, and features
* Paper or other resource for more information
* Citation details
* License
* Where to send questions or comments about the model
## Intended Use. Use cases that were envisioned during development.
* Primary intended uses
* Primary intended users
* Out-of-scope use cases
## Factors. Factors could include demographic or phenotypic
groups, environmental conditions, technical attributes, or others listed in Section 4.3.
* Relevant factors
* Evaluation factors
## Metrics. Metrics should be chosen to reflect potential real- world impacts of the model.
* Model performance measures
* Decision thresholds
* Variation approaches
## Evaluation Data. Details on the dataset(s) used for the
quantitative analyses in the card. 
* Datasets
* Motivation
* Preprocessing
## Training Data. May not be possible to provide in practice. When possible, this section should mirror Evaluation Data. If such detail is not possible, minimal allowable information should be provided here, such as details of the distribution over various factors in the training datasets.
## Quantitative Analyses * Unitary results
* Intersectional results
## Ethical Considerations
## Caveats and Recommendations
